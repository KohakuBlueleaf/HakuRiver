# Setting Up Notifications

HakuRiver does not have a built-in alerting system. However, you can set up external notifications for task failures or node status changes by leveraging the available monitoring methods. This guide provides examples using simple scripting and systemd.

## Notifying on Task Failures

The most common notification need is to be alerted when a task fails.

### Method 1: Scripting and Polling

You can write a script that periodically checks for failed tasks and sends a notification.

1.  **Write a Check Script:** Create a script that uses `hakuriver.client` to list tasks and identify recent failures.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # check_failed_tasks.sh

    # Get the last N tasks (adjust as needed)
    # Note: The /api/tasks endpoint may not support limits/filtering easily yet.
    # A robust script might fetch all tasks and filter by completion time.
    # For simplicity, let's assume we can get recent ones or check all.

    # Using `hakuriver.client status` for a list of known task IDs might be more reliable
    # if you track task IDs submitted via scripting, but requires tracking.
    # A simple approach checking ALL tasks and storing seen IDs might be needed.

    # Example (less robust, checks ALL tasks, might re-notify):
    FAILED_TASKS=$(hakuriver.client tasks 2>/dev/null | jq -c '.[] | select(.status == "failed" or .status == "killed" or .status == "lost" or .status == "killed_oom")')

    if [ -z "$FAILED_TASKS" ]; then
      # No failed tasks found
      exit 0
    fi

    echo "HakuRiver Task Failures Detected:"

    echo "$FAILED_TASKS" | while read task_json; do
      TASK_ID=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.task_id')
      STATUS=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.status')
      COMMAND=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.command')
      NODE=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.assigned_node')
      ERROR_MSG=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.error_message')

      echo "--- Task ID: $TASK_ID ---"
      echo "Status: $STATUS"
      echo "Command: $COMMAND"
      echo "Assigned Node: $NODE"
      echo "Error: ${ERROR_MSG:-N/A}" # Use N/A if error_message is null
      echo "------------------------"
    done

    # Send notification (example: email)
    # mail -s "HakuRiver Alert: Task Failures" admin@yourdomain.com < /tmp/task_failure_report.txt # Assuming report is saved to a temp file
    # Or pipe directly:
    # (echo "HakuRiver Task Failures Detected:"; echo "$FAILED_TASKS" | ...) | mail -s "HakuRiver Alert: Task Failures" admin@yourdomain.com

    # Example (Slack webhook using curl and JQ)
    # SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
    # PAYLOAD=$(echo "$FAILED_TASKS" | jq -s '{text: "HakuRiver Task Failures Detected", attachments: [.[] | {title: "Task \(.task_id) Failed (\(.status))", text: "Command: \(.command)\nNode: \(.assigned_node)\nError: \(.error_message // "N/A")", color: "danger"}]}')
    # curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "$PAYLOAD" $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

    exit 1 # Exit with non-zero to indicate failures were found
    ```
    *Requires `jq` command-line JSON processor.* Adjust the filtering (`select`) and output format for your needs and notification method (email, Slack, Mattermost, PagerDuty, etc.).

2.  **Schedule the Script:** Use `cron` on a client or monitoring machine to run the script periodically.

    ```bash
    # Run the check script every 15 minutes
    */15 * * * * /path/to/your/check_failed_tasks.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```
    *Note:* This simple script will re-notify for the same failed tasks unless you implement state tracking (e.g., store notified task IDs in a file).

### Method 2: Using Systemd `OnFailure`

Systemd allows triggering actions when a service unit fails. While HakuRiver tasks are transient `scope` units, the `hakuriver-runner.service` itself *could* be configured to trigger something if it fails, but this doesn't notify per-task.

A more advanced approach might involve:
1.  Modifying the Runner code to execute a local script upon task completion (success or failure).
2.  This local script would then perform the notification based on the task's exit status.

This requires modifying the Runner's internal task execution loop, which is beyond standard configuration.

## Notifying on Node Status Changes

You can be alerted when a Runner node goes offline or comes back online.

### Method 1: Scripting and Polling

Write a script that uses `hakuriver.client nodes` or `hakuriver.client health` to check node statuses.

1.  **Write a Check Script:**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # check_node_status.sh

    # File to store previous state (create an empty file initially)
    STATE_FILE="/tmp/hakuriver_node_state.json"
    TOUCH "$STATE_FILE" # Ensure file exists

    # Get current node status
    CURRENT_STATUS=$(hakuriver.client nodes 2>/dev/null | jq -c '.[] | {hostname: .hostname, status: .status}')

    if [ -z "$CURRENT_STATUS" ]; then
      echo "Error: Could not get node status from HakuRiver Host." >&2
      exit 1
    fi

    # Read previous state
    PREVIOUS_STATUS=$(cat "$STATE_FILE")

    # Update state file for next run
    echo "$CURRENT_STATUS" > "$STATE_FILE"

    # Compare current and previous states
    # This requires parsing both JSON streams and comparing
    # A more robust script might use tools like `json-diff` or process line by line

    # Simple comparison logic (may have edge cases):
    if [ "$CURRENT_STATUS" != "$PREVIOUS_STATUS" ]; then
      echo "HakuRiver Node Status Change Detected!"

      # --- Example: Identify changes (requires careful parsing/comparison) ---
      # A simple approach might be to just list current online/offline nodes if any change detected.
      # OFFLINE_NODES=$(echo "$CURRENT_STATUS" | jq -c '. | select(.status == "offline")')
      # ONLINE_NODES=$(echo "$CURRENT_STATUS" | jq -c '. | select(.status == "online")')
      # ... format notification ...

      # Or use a Python script for easier JSON processing and state management
      python -c "
import json
import sys

current = [json.loads(line) for line in sys.argv[1].split('\\n') if line]
previous = [json.loads(line) for line in sys.argv[2].split('\\n') if line]

current_dict = {node['hostname']: node['status'] for node in current}
previous_dict = {node['hostname']: node['status'] for node in previous}

changes = []
for hostname in set(current_dict.keys()) | set(previous_dict.keys()):
    current_status = current_dict.get(hostname, 'unknown')
    previous_status = previous_dict.get(hostname, 'unknown')

    if current_status != previous_status:
        changes.append(f'- Node {hostname}: {previous_status} -> {current_status}')

if changes:
    print('HakuRiver Node Status Change Detected:')
    print('\\n'.join(changes))
    # Add notification logic here (e.g., call mail, curl to webhook)
    # Example:
    # import subprocess
    # notification_body = 'HakuRiver Node Status Change Detected:\\n' + '\\n'.join(changes)
    # subprocess.run(['mail', '-s', 'HakuRiver Node Status Alert', 'admin@yourdomain.com'], input=notification_body.encode())

    sys.exit(1) # Indicate change found
else:
    sys.exit(0) # No change
" "$CURRENT_STATUS" "$PREVIOUS_STATUS" # Pass status as arguments to Python
    fi

    exit 0
    ```
    *Requires `jq` and potentially Python.* This script compares the current state to a saved state file to detect changes and avoids spamming notifications if a node stays offline.

2.  **Schedule the Script:** Use `cron` to run the script periodically.

    ```bash
    # Run the check script every 5 minutes
    */5 * * * * /path/to/your/check_node_status.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```

## Key Considerations for Notifications

-   **Notification Method:** Choose a notification method suitable for your team (email, Slack webhook, Mattermost webhook, PagerDuty API, etc.).
-   **Scripting Location:** Run notification scripts on a machine that is stable and has network access to the HakuRiver Host and the notification endpoint.
-   **State Management:** For status change notifications (like node status), implement simple state tracking (e.g., using files) to avoid repeatedly notifying about the same state.
-   **Frequency:** Schedule check scripts to run at an appropriate frequency (e.g., every few minutes for critical nodes, less often for task failure summaries).
-   **Filtering:** Refine your scripts to filter for specific tasks, nodes, or error types if needed.
-   **Security:** Be cautious with storing credentials for notification endpoints (e.g., webhook URLs) if required by your method.

By scripting against the HakuRiver API endpoints and using standard system tools like `cron`, `mail`, `curl`, or `jq`, you can build a basic notification system tailored to your needs.
