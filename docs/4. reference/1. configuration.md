# Configuration Reference (`config.toml`)

HakuRiver uses a TOML configuration file to manage settings for the Host, Runner, and Client components. This reference details the available options.

**Default Location:** `~/.hakuriver/config.toml`

You can override the default location using the `--config /path/to/custom.toml` flag with any `hakuriver.*` command. The configuration values are loaded once on startup for Host and Runner, and on each command execution for Client CLIs. Settings specified via a `--config` file take precedence over the default `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` or built-in defaults.

Sections and keys are read into corresponding attributes of `HOST_CONFIG`, `RUNNER_CONFIG`, and `CLIENT_CONFIG` objects internally.

## Sections

### `[network]`

Network settings for communication between components. These settings are typically required on Host, Runner, and Client machines, configured appropriately for each role.

*   `host_bind_ip` (string, default: `"0.0.0.0"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   The IP address the **Host** server binds to for listening on `host_port` and `host_ssh_proxy_port`. `0.0.0.0` makes it listen on all available network interfaces. Configure this on the Host node.
*   `host_port` (integer, default: `8000`)
    *   **Used by:** Host, Runner, Client
    *   The TCP port the **Host** server listens on for the main API (registration, task submission, status updates, etc.). Configure this on the Host node (where it binds) and on Runner and Client nodes (so they know where to connect).
*   `host_ssh_proxy_port` (integer, default: `8002`)
    *   **Used by:** Host, Client (`hakuriver.ssh`)
    *   The TCP port the **Host** server listens on for incoming SSH proxy connections from `hakuriver.ssh` clients. Configure this on the Host node (where it binds) and on Client machines (so `hakuriver.ssh` knows where to connect).
*   `host_reachable_address` (string, **CRITICAL**, default: `"127.0.0.1"`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner, Client, Host (for internal reference)
    *   The IP address or hostname that **Runners** and **Clients** use to connect to the Host server's `host_port` and `host_ssh_proxy_port`. **Must be changed** from `127.0.0.1` in any multi-machine setup to the actual reachable IP/hostname of the Host node. Configure this on Host, Runner, and Client nodes.
*   `runner_address` (string, **CRITICAL**, default: `"127.0.1.1"`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner, Host
    *   The IP address or hostname of *this specific Runner* accessible by the Host (e.g., for sending kill signals, status updates, or SSH proxy connections back to the Runner's dynamic VPS ports). **Must be changed** from the default on *each* Runner node to its own unique, reachable IP/hostname. Configure this only on Runner nodes.
*   `runner_port` (integer, default: `8001`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner, Host
    *   The TCP port the **Runner** agent listens on for commands from the Host (e.g., `/run`, `/kill`, `/pause`, `/resume`). Configure this on the Runner node (where it binds) and on the Host node (so it knows where to send commands - though Host primarily uses the URL reported during registration, this is a fallback).

### `[paths]`

Filesystem paths used by HakuRiver components. Configure these on the relevant nodes.

*   `shared_dir` (string, **CRITICAL**, default: `"test/shared"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host, Runner
    *   The **absolute path** to the shared filesystem directory mounted on **all** nodes (Host and Runners). This path is used by the Host to store container tarballs and read logs, and by the Runner to read tarballs, write logs, and access shared data. Ensure this directory exists and is writable by the HakuRiver user on all relevant nodes. The logical path configured here can differ between nodes as long as it points to the same physical storage.
*   `local_temp_dir` (string, default: `"test/temp"`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   The **absolute path** to a local temporary directory on each **Runner** node. This should ideally be on fast storage (like an SSD or NVMe). It is used by the Runner for temporary operations and is mounted into Docker containers as `/local_temp`. Ensure it exists and is writable by the Runner user. Configure this only on Runner nodes.
*   `numactl_path` (string, default: `""`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   The **absolute path** to the `numactl` executable on **Runner** nodes. Only required if you intend to use the NUMA targeting feature (`--target node:numa_id`) with the systemd fallback execution method (`--container NULL`). If empty or `numactl` is not found at this path, NUMA binding for systemd tasks will be disabled. Configure this only on Runner nodes.
*   `host_log_file` (string, default: `"host.log"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   Optional: Path to the log file for the **Host** server. If empty, logs go to the console (stdout/stderr). Relative paths are relative to the Host service's `WorkingDirectory` (often `shared_dir` if using `hakuriver.init service`). Configure this on the Host node.
*   `runner_log_file` (string, default: `"runner.log"`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   Optional: Path to the log file for the **Runner** agent. If empty, logs go to the console. The runner will automatically append its hostname before the `.log` extension (e.g., `runner-compute01.log`). Relative paths are relative to the Runner service's `WorkingDirectory` (often `shared_dir` if using `hakuriver.init service`). Configure this only on Runner nodes.

### `[database]`

Host server database settings. Configure this only on the Host node.

*   `db_file` (string, default: `"test/cluster_management.db"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   Path to the SQLite database file used by the **Host** server to store node and task information. Ensure the directory exists and is writable by the user running the Host server. Relative paths are relative to the Host service's `WorkingDirectory`.

### `[timing]`

Timing and interval settings. Configure these on the relevant nodes.

*   `heartbeat_interval` (integer, default: `5`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   Interval in seconds at which **Runners** send heartbeat signals to the Host. Configure this on Runner nodes.
*   `heartbeat_timeout_factor` (integer, default: `6`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   Multiplier for `heartbeat_interval`. A Runner is marked 'offline' by the Host if no heartbeat is received for `heartbeat_interval * heartbeat_timeout_factor` seconds. Configure this on the Host node.
*   `cleanup_check_interval` (integer, default: `10`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   Interval in seconds at which the **Host** checks for offline runners and potentially cleans up related state. Configure this on the Host node.
*   `resource_check_interval` (integer, default: `1`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   Interval in seconds for internal resource monitoring checks (CPU, Memory, GPU, Temperature) performed by the Runner. Configure this on Runner nodes.

### `[environment]`

Settings related to the execution environment. Configure these on Runner nodes.

*   `runner_user` (string, default: `""`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner
    *   Optional: Specify the system username under which tasks should be run by the **Runner** when using the systemd fallback (`--container NULL`). If empty, tasks run as the user who started the `hakuriver.runner` process. **Note:** The Runner service user might still need passwordless `sudo` to execute `systemd-run` as this `runner_user`.

### `[docker]`

Settings related to Docker container management and execution. Configure these on Host and Runner nodes.

*   `container_dir` (string, default: `"hakuriver-containers"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host, Runner
    *   The name of the subdirectory within `shared_dir` where HakuRiver container tarballs are stored (e.g., `<shared_dir>/hakuriver-containers/`). This must be consistent across Host and Runners.
*   `default_container_name` (string, default: `"hakuriver-base"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host, Client (CLIs like `hakuriver.task`, `hakuriver.vps`)
    *   The default HakuRiver environment name used for tasks if the `--container` flag is not specified during submission. The corresponding Docker image tag used by Runners will be `hakuriver/<default_container_name>:base`. Configure this on the Host (for creating the initial tarball) and Clients (so they know the default name).
*   `initial_base_image` (string, default: `"python:3.12.10-alpine3.21"`)
    *   **Used by:** Host
    *   The public Docker image (e.g., from Docker Hub) used by the **Host** to automatically create the *initial* tarball for the `default_container_name` *only* if no tarball for that name exists in the `container_dir` when the Host starts. Ignored if a tarball already exists. Configure this on the Host node.
*   `tasks_privileged` (boolean, default: `false`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner (based on info from Host), Host (default value)
    *   Default setting for whether Docker tasks should use the `--privileged` flag. This can be overridden per task using the `--privileged` flag in `hakuriver.task submit` or `hakuriver.vps submit`. Configure this on the Host (where the default is defined).
*   `additional_mounts` (array of strings, default: `[]`)
    *   **Used by:** Runner (based on info from Host), Host (default value)
    *   A list of default host-to-container directory mounts applied to **all** Docker tasks. Each string must be in the format `"host_path:container_path"`. This can be overridden per task using the `--mount` flag in `hakuriver.task submit` or `hakuriver.vps submit`. Example: `["/data/shared:/shared_data:ro", "/scratch:/local_scratch"]`. Configure this on the Host (where the default is defined). The Runner must be able to access `host_path`.

### General Client Configuration (Client-side only)

The `CLIENT_CONFIG` object in `src/hakuriver/core/config.py` is populated from the `[network]` section and includes some default timeouts. These defaults are typically sufficient but can be indirectly affected by setting `host_reachable_address` and `host_port` in your client's config. Specific timeouts might be added to the config file structure later if needed.

For now, client-side config primarily ensures the CLIs know how to reach the Host API and SSH proxy:

```toml
# ~/.hakuriver/config.toml on CLIENT machines

[network]
# Address of the HakuRiver Host server
host_reachable_address = "192.168.1.100" # <--- CHANGE THIS

# Port of the HakuRiver Host API
host_port = 8000 # <--- CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# Port of the HakuRiver Host SSH proxy (for hakuriver.ssh)
host_ssh_proxy_port = 8002 # <--- CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED
```

These client-side settings are loaded by CLIs like `hakuriver.client`, `hakuriver.task`, `hakuriver.vps`, `hakuriver.docker`, `hakuriver.docker-shell`, and `hakuriver.ssh`.
