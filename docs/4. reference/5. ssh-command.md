# SSH Client Reference (`hakuriver.ssh`)

This document provides a detailed reference for the `hakuriver.ssh` CLI command, used specifically for connecting to a **running HakuRiver VPS task** via the Host's built-in SSH proxy.

For submitting and managing VPS tasks, see the [VPS Commands Reference](../4. vps-commands.md).

## Usage

```bash
hakuriver.ssh [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <TASK_ID> [SSH_OPTIONS...]
```

-   `[GLOBAL OPTIONS]`: Options that configure the `hakuriver.ssh` client proxy itself.
-   `<TASK_ID>`: The ID of the running VPS task you want to connect to. This is the only required argument.
-   `[SSH_OPTIONS...]`: Additional options to pass directly to the underlying system `ssh` command (e.g., `-p`, `-v`, `-i /path/to/key`). Note that some options like `-p` and the target user are set by `hakuriver.ssh` itself and may be overridden if specified here.

## Global Options (for `hakuriver.ssh` proxy client)

*   `--config PATH`
    *   Specify the path to a custom TOML configuration file. Overrides settings found in the default location (`~/.hakuriver/config.toml`) for this command execution.
*   `--host HOST_ADDRESS`
    *   Override the HakuRiver Host address (`[network] host_reachable_address`) from the configuration file. Use this if the Host is reachable at a different address from where you are running `hakuriver.ssh`.
*   `--proxy-port PORT`
    *   Override the HakuRiver Host SSH proxy port (`[network] host_ssh_proxy_port`) from the configuration file. Use this if the Host proxy is listening on a non-default port.
*   `--local-port PORT` (integer, default: `0`):
    *   Specify a specific local port on your client machine for the `hakuriver.ssh` client proxy to listen on. By default (`0`), the operating system chooses a random free port. Use this if you need to bind to a specific port (e.g., for firewall reasons), but be aware it might fail if the port is in use.
*   `--user USER` (string, default: `root`):
    *   Specify the username to use when connecting via SSH to the container. HakuRiver's default VPS setup injects the public key into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. If your container environment is configured to run SSH for a different user and you injected the key for that user, specify it here.

## Arguments

*   `TASK_ID` (required): The unique Task ID of the running HakuRiver VPS task. Obtain this from `hakuriver.vps status`.

## How it Works (User Perspective)

1.  You identify the Task ID of your running VPS using `hakuriver.vps status`.
2.  You run `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>`.
3.  `hakuriver.ssh` starts a small local TCP server on your machine (by default, on a random free port on `127.0.0.1`).
4.  It then connects to the HakuRiver Host's SSH proxy port (`host_ssh_proxy_port` from your config).
5.  It sends the `TASK_ID` to the Host proxy.
6.  The Host proxy looks up the task, finds the Runner's IP and the VPS container's specific SSH port, and connects to it.
7.  The Host proxy sends a "SUCCESS" message back to your local `hakuriver.ssh` client.
8.  Your `hakuriver.ssh` client automatically launches your system's standard `ssh` command, directing it to connect to `127.0.0.1` on the local port it just opened.
9.  Your standard `ssh` client traffic flows into the local proxy, which forwards it to the Host proxy, which forwards it to the Runner/VPS container.
10. Your standard `ssh` client proceeds with authentication using your SSH keys. If the public key you provided during VPS submission matches your local private key, and your key is loaded (e.g., via `ssh-agent`), you'll connect successfully.

## Examples

1.  **Connect to a VPS task using default settings:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.ssh 7323718749301768192
    ```
    This will connect to `root@127.0.0.1` on a random local port, proxying through the Host configured in `~/.hakuriver/config.toml`.

2.  **Connect specifying a custom config file:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.ssh --config ~/.hakuriver/vps_config.toml 7323718749301768192
    ```

3.  **Connect specifying a different Host address and proxy port:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.ssh --host 10.10.1.5 --proxy-port 2222 7323718749301768192
    ```

4.  **Connect as a different user inside the container:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.ssh --user myuser 7323718749301768192
    ```
    *Note: This requires the container environment to be set up to allow SSH login for `myuser` with your key.*

5.  **Pass additional options to the underlying `ssh` client:**
    ```bash
    # Connect and request verbose output from the SSH client for debugging
    hakuriver.ssh 7323718749301768192 -v

    # Connect using a specific local private key file (rarely needed if key is in ~/.ssh)
    hakuriver.ssh 7323718749301768192 -i ~/.ssh/my_special_key
    ```

## Disconnecting

To end the VPS session, simply type `exit` in the container shell or close the terminal window where you ran `hakuriver.ssh`. The `hakuriver.ssh` process will detect the disconnected SSH client, shut down its local proxy listener, and close the connection through the Host proxy. The VPS container on the Runner node will remain running (unless explicitly killed or it crashes).

## Troubleshooting

If `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>` fails:

1.  **Verify VPS Task Status**: Check `hakuriver.vps status`. Ensure the task ID is correct and the status is 'running' or 'paused'.
2.  **Check HakuRiver Config**: Verify `host_reachable_address` and `host_ssh_proxy_port` in your `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` on the client machine are correct and match the Host's configuration.
3.  **Network Path to Host**: Ensure your client machine can reach the Host's IP and `host_ssh_proxy_port` (e.g., check firewalls).
4.  **SSH Client Availability**: Ensure the standard `ssh` command is installed and in your PATH.
5.  **SSH Authentication Issues**: If the `hakuriver.ssh` command runs but the standard `ssh` client connection fails (e.g., "Permission denied", "Authenticaton failed"), the issue is likely with the SSH key or container configuration.
    -   Did you provide the correct public key when submitting the VPS?
    -   Is the corresponding private key available to your local SSH client (`ssh-add -l`)?
    -   Is the container environment correctly configured for SSH public key authentication (e.g., `PermitRootLogin yes` in `sshd_config` if connecting as root)?
6.  **Host/Runner Issues**: If the problem persists, check the logs on the Host (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service`) and the assigned Runner node (`journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`). The Host logs will show if it received the proxy request and if it could connect to the Runner/VPS port. The Runner logs may show errors related to the Docker container or SSH daemon startup.

## Security Considerations

-   The Host SSH proxy port (`host_ssh_proxy_port`) should be secured via firewalls, allowing connections only from trusted client IPs or networks.
-   Always use SSH public key authentication for VPS tasks. The default setup is vulnerable if the container environment is not hardened and grants root access without requiring a key.
-   Protect your private SSH key securely.

See the [Security Guide](../2. admin-guides/5. security.md) for more comprehensive security recommendations.
