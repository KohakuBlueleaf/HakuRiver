# VPS Task Management Reference (`hakuriver.vps`)

This document provides a detailed reference for the `hakuriver.vps` CLI commands, used specifically for submitting and managing **VPS tasks** (persistent interactive sessions) in HakuRiver.

For managing standard command tasks, see the [Command Task Submission Reference](../3. task-commands.md).
For general cluster commands (nodes, health, general status/kill/command by ID), see the [Client Commands Reference](../2. client-commands.md).
For connecting to a running VPS task, see the [SSH Client Command Reference](../5. ssh-command.md).

## Usage

```bash
hakuriver.vps [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [COMMAND OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS]
```

-   `[GLOBAL OPTIONS]`: Options that apply to the client itself, like specifying a configuration file.
-   `<COMMAND>`: The specific command to perform (`submit`, `status`, `kill`, `command`).
-   `[COMMAND OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS]`: Options or arguments specific to the chosen VPS command.

## Global Options

*   `--config PATH`
    *   Specify the path to a custom TOML configuration file. Overrides settings found in the default location (`~/.hakuriver/config.toml`) for this command execution.

## Commands

### `submit`

Submits a new VPS task to the HakuRiver cluster. This command launches a persistent Docker container configured for SSH access on a target node.

*   **Description:** Packages the required information (public key, target, resources) and sends them to the Host API for scheduling and dispatching to a Runner node. A VPS task always targets a single node, although it can request resources on that node (NUMA, GPUs).
*   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.vps submit [submit OPTIONS]
    ```
*   **Submit Options:**
    *   `--target HOST[:NUMA_ID][::GPU_ID1[,GPU_ID2,...]]`: Specifies the target node for the VPS. **Only one instance of --target is allowed for VPS.**
        *   `HOST`: Hostname of a registered Runner node.
        *   `:NUMA_ID` (optional): Integer ID of a NUMA node on the target host to bind the container to.
        *   `::GPU_ID1[,GPU_ID2,...]` (optional): Comma-separated integer GPU IDs to make available to the container. Valid only with Docker containers (`--container` not `NULL`).
        *   If `--target` is **omitted**, the Host will attempt to auto-select a suitable node based on the requested resources (`--cores`, `--memory`, implicitly GPU if specified).
    *   `--public-key-string KEY_STRING`: Provide your SSH public key directly as a string. Mutually exclusive with `--public-key-file`.
    *   `--public-key-file PATH`: Path to a file containing your SSH public key (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). If neither `--public-key-string` nor `--public-key-file` is specified, HakuRiver attempts to read `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` by default. **A public key is required.**
    *   `--cores N` (integer, default: `0`): Number of CPU cores required for the VPS. `0` signals the Host to auto-select resources. Used by Host for scheduling and Runner for allocation.
    *   `--memory SIZE` (string, default: `None`): Memory limit for the VPS (e.g., `512M`, `4G`). Uses 1000-based units (K, M, G). Optional. Used by Host for scheduling and Runner for allocation.
    *   `--container NAME` (string, default: `default_container_name` from config): The HakuRiver container environment name to use. VPS tasks **require** a Docker container environment (cannot use `"NULL"`). The selected container **must** have an SSH server installed and configured (see [Container Workflow Guide](../1. container-workflow.md)).
    *   `--privileged` (boolean flag): Run the Docker container with the `--privileged` flag. Overrides the default. Use with extreme caution.
    *   `--mount HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH`: Mount an additional directory from the host into the Docker container. Can be repeated. Overrides default mounts.

*   **Examples:**
    ```bash
    # Submit a VPS task using default config (auto-select node, default container, default key)
    hakuriver.vps submit

    # Submit a VPS task to nodeA with specific cores/memory/key file
    hakuriver.vps submit --target nodeA --cores 4 --memory 8G --public-key-file ~/.ssh/my_vps_key.pub

    # Submit a VPS task to nodeB targeting NUMA node 0 with key string
    hakuriver.vps submit --target nodeB:0 --public-key-string "ssh-rsa AAAA..." --container my-ubuntu-vps

    # Submit a VPS task to nodeC using GPUs 0 and 1
    hakuriver.vps submit --target nodeC::0,1 --container my-cuda-vps --public-key-file ~/.ssh/gpu_key.pub
    ```

### `status`

Lists all active VPS tasks (pending, assigning, running, paused).

*   **Description:** Queries a specific Host API endpoint (`/vps/status`) designed to list only VPS tasks that are not in a final state (completed, failed, killed, lost).
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.vps status`
*   **Output:** A table listing active VPS tasks by `task_id`, `status`, `assigned_node`, `required_cores`, `required_memory_bytes`, `required_gpus`, `submitted_at`, `started_at`, and `ssh_port`. The SSH port is shown for tasks with status `running`.

### `kill TASK_ID`

Requests the Host to terminate a VPS task by its ID. This stops the underlying Docker container.

*   **Description:** Sends a kill request to the Host. The Host updates the task status in its DB and signals the assigned Runner to stop the VPS container.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.vps kill TASK_ID`
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `TASK_ID` (required): The ID of the VPS task to kill.
*   **Output:** Confirmation message from the Host. The task's status will eventually change to `killed`.

### `command TASK_ID ACTION`

Sends a specific control command to a VPS task by its ID. Currently supports `pause` and `resume` actions.

*   **Description:** Sends a command request to the Host. The Host validates the task status and action, then forwards the command (`docker pause` or `docker unpause`) to the assigned Runner for the VPS container.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.vps command TASK_ID ACTION`
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `TASK_ID` (required): The ID of the VPS task.
    *   `ACTION` (required): The control action. Currently accepts `pause` or `resume`.
*   **Output:** Confirmation message from the Host forwarding the command. The task's status will eventually change to `paused` or `running` if the action is successful on the Runner.
