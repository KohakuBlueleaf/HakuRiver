# Client Commands Reference (`hakuriver.client`)

The `hakuriver.client` command is a multi-purpose tool for general interaction with the HakuRiver cluster. It allows you to list nodes, check their health, and manage the status of *any* task (Command or VPS) by its ID.

Task submission is handled by separate commands: `hakuriver.task submit` for command tasks and `hakuriver.vps submit` for VPS tasks. Managing VPS-specific actions like SSH access is handled by `hakuriver.vps status` and `hakuriver.ssh`.

## Usage

```bash
hakuriver.client [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [COMMAND OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS]
```

-   `[GLOBAL OPTIONS]`: Options that apply to the client itself, like specifying a configuration file.
-   `<COMMAND>`: One of the specific commands listed below (e.g., `nodes`, `health`, `status`, `kill`, `command`).
-   `[COMMAND OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS]`: Arguments specific to the chosen command.

## Global Options

*   `--config PATH`
    *   Specify the path to a custom TOML configuration file. Overrides settings found in the default location (`~/.hakuriver/config.toml`) for this command execution.

## Commands

### `nodes`

Lists all registered Runner nodes with basic status and resource summaries.

*   **Description:** Queries the Host for information about all known Runner nodes.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.client nodes`
*   **Output:** A table listing nodes by hostname, status (online/offline), URL, total CPU cores, available cores, NUMA node count, GPU count, and last heartbeat time.

### `health [HOSTNAME]`

Provides detailed health and resource usage information for nodes, including CPU/Memory usage, temperature, NUMA topology, and detailed GPU status.

*   **Description:** Queries the Host for real-time health metrics.
*   **Usage:**
    *   `hakuriver.client health`: Get aggregated health status for the cluster and detailed health for all nodes.
    *   `hakuriver.client health HOSTNAME`: Get detailed health status specifically for the node identified by `HOSTNAME`.
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `[HOSTNAME]` (optional): The hostname of a specific Runner node.
*   **Output:** Prints structured information, often in JSON format, detailing current resource percentages, temperatures, and (if reported) NUMA topology and GPU details for the node(s).

### `status TASK_ID`

Checks and displays the detailed status of a specific task (Command or VPS) using its unique Task ID.

*   **Description:** Queries the Host for the full record of a task.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.client status TASK_ID`
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `TASK_ID` (required): The ID of the task.
*   **Output:** Prints a JSON object containing comprehensive details about the task, including command, arguments, status, assigned node, required resources, log paths, timestamps, exit code, error message, container details, target NUMA ID, batch ID, and SSH port (for VPS tasks).

### `kill TASK_ID`

Requests the Host to terminate a running, pending, or assigning task by its ID. This applies to both Command and VPS tasks.

*   **Description:** Sends a kill request to the Host. The Host then updates the task status in its DB and signals the assigned Runner to stop the task's process or container.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.client kill TASK_ID`
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `TASK_ID` (required): The ID of the task to kill.
*   **Output:** Confirmation message from the Host. The task's status will eventually change to `killed` (or `failed` if the kill failed on the Runner).

### `command TASK_ID ACTION`

Sends a specific control command to a task by its ID. Currently supports `pause` and `resume` actions for running tasks. This applies to both Command and VPS tasks (if supported by their execution method).

*   **Description:** Sends a command request to the Host. The Host validates the task status and action, then forwards the command to the assigned Runner.
*   **Usage:** `hakuriver.client command TASK_ID ACTION`
*   **Arguments:**
    *   `TASK_ID` (required): The ID of the task.
    *   `ACTION` (required): The control action. Currently accepts `pause` or `resume`.
*   **Output:** Confirmation message from the Host forwarding the command. The task's status will eventually change to `paused` or `running` if the action is successful on the Runner.

## Examples

1.  **List all registered nodes:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client nodes
    ```

2.  **Get detailed health for node 'compute01':**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client health compute01
    ```

3.  **Check the status of task 1234567890:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client status 1234567890
    ```

4.  **Request to kill task 9876543210:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client kill 9876543210
    ```

5.  **Pause task 1122334455:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client command 1122334455 pause
    ```
