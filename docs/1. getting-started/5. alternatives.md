# Comparison with Alternatives

HakuRiver is designed to fill a specific niche: managing command-line tasks and interactive container sessions on a small to medium-sized cluster (typically 3-10 nodes) with minimal overhead. This section outlines how it compares to other common tools and systems you might consider.

## HakuRiver vs. Manual SSH/Scripts

**Manual SSH/Scripts:**
- **Pros:** Very simple for 1-3 machines, no setup required beyond SSH. Direct control.
- **Cons:** Becomes cumbersome quickly with more machines or complex tasks. No centralized status tracking. Difficult to manage resources. Reproducibility relies heavily on manual environment setup on each machine. No easy way to distribute jobs automatically. No concept of on-demand interactive environments (VPS).

**HakuRiver:**
- **Pros:** Centralized node and task management. Automated task distribution. Built-in status tracking and logging. Reproducible environments via Docker sync. Resource allocation hints/enforcement. Provides structured VPS sessions. Scalable up to ~20 nodes without significant complexity increase.
- **Cons:** Requires initial setup (Host, Runner, shared storage, Docker). Adds a layer of abstraction. Not suitable for single-machine use (though Host/Runner can run on the same machine).

**Verdict:** HakuRiver is a significant step up from purely manual management once you have more than a couple of machines or need reproducibility and tracking.

## HakuRiver vs. Traditional HPC Schedulers (Slurm, PBS, LSF, Grid Engine)

**Traditional HPC Schedulers:**
- **Pros:** Designed for large-scale clusters (hundreds to thousands of nodes). Sophisticated scheduling policies. Robust job dependency management. Mature and battle-tested for tightly coupled parallel jobs and complex workflows.
- **Cons:** Very complex to install, configure, and manage. High administrative overhead. Often requires specific OS/network setups. Can be overkill and burdensome for small clusters. User interfaces can be less intuitive for simple tasks. Primarily batch-oriented, interactive sessions often require specific configurations or limitations.

**HakuRiver:**
- **Pros:** Lightweight and simple to set up and manage. Minimal administrative overhead. Easy task submission for simple command-line jobs. Focuses on environment reproducibility. Provides straightforward on-demand interactive VPS sessions. "Just right" for small clusters.
- **Cons:** Not designed for large scale. Scheduling is basic (primarily direct targeting, simple resource checks). Limited/no support for complex job dependencies or workflows (use external tools like Snakemake or Nextflow). Less granular resource control than some HPC systems.

**Verdict:** If you have a small cluster and primarily run independent or simple batch tasks, HakuRiver offers a much lower barrier to entry and less operational burden than traditional HPC schedulers. If you manage a large cluster, require advanced scheduling features, or complex job dependencies, HPC schedulers are the appropriate choice.

## HakuRiver vs. Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad)

**Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad):**
- **Pros:** Excellent for deploying and managing complex, multi-service applications. Handles scaling, self-healing, service discovery, rolling updates, etc. Designed for cloud-native applications and microservices.
- **Cons:** Significant complexity for simple task distribution. Overkill for just running a single command or interactive session on a node. Requires understanding concepts like Pods, Services, Deployments, etc. Docker is used for application packaging, not primarily as a simple environment tool.

**HakuRiver:**
- **Pros:** Much simpler for its intended use case. Treats Docker as a portable environment rather than an application package. Easy task submission directly mapping to commands. Provides dedicated VPS task type. Lower overhead for simple compute needs.
- **Cons:** Not designed for deploying multi-service applications or ensuring high availability of services. Doesn't handle rolling updates, load balancing (beyond simple distribution), complex service discovery.

**Verdict:** If your goal is to run computational tasks or provide simple interactive environments, HakuRiver is significantly simpler than Kubernetes. If your goal is to deploy complex applications as sets of interdependent services, use a container orchestration platform.

## HakuRiver vs. Simple Automation Tools (Ansible, Fabric)

**Automation Tools (Ansible, Fabric):**
- **Pros:** Great for automating setup, deployment, and running ad-hoc commands across machines. Agentless (Ansible) or uses SSH directly. Flexible for system administration tasks.
- **Cons:** Not designed as a persistent task scheduler. No built-in status tracking of long-running jobs after the script finishes. Limited resource management capabilities. Environment setup needs to be managed separately or scripted within the automation logic.

**HakuRiver:**
- **Pros:** Explicit task lifecycle management (pending, running, completed, etc.). Centralized state and monitoring. Designed for running tasks that persist beyond the submission command. Handles environment sync automatically.
- **Cons:** Not as flexible for general system configuration or management tasks across nodes.

**Verdict:** HakuRiver complements automation tools. Use Ansible/Fabric for setting up nodes and installing prerequisites (like Docker, HakuRiver, shared storage clients). Use HakuRiver for submitting and managing the actual computational tasks.
