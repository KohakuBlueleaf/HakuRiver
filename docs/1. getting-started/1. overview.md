# HakuRiver Overview

## What is HakuRiver?

HakuRiver is a lightweight, self-hosted cluster manager designed for distributing command-line tasks and launching persistent interactive sessions (**VPS Tasks**) across multiple compute nodes. It provides a simple yet powerful solution for research labs, small teams, and home labs that need to efficiently utilize a modest number of machines (typically 3-10 nodes), leveraging **Docker containers as reproducible environments**.

## The Problem HakuRiver Solves

Small to medium research teams often find themselves in an awkward middle ground when it comes to distributed computing:

- **Too many machines** to manage manually with SSH and shell scripts
- **Too few machines** to justify the overhead of complex HPC schedulers like Slurm
- **Unsuitable complexity** of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes for simple task distribution or on-demand interactive environments.

This creates a situation where you have powerful compute resources but lack an efficient way to utilize them as a unified computing resource without significant operational overhead.

## Core Concept: Your Nodes as One Big Computer

HakuRiver addresses this problem by letting you treat your small cluster as a single powerful computer, with these key design principles:

- **Lightweight Resource Management**: Distribute command-line tasks and interactive VPS sessions across your nodes with minimal setup.
- **Environment Consistency**: Use Docker containers as portable virtual environments, ensuring tasks run in identical setups everywhere.
- **Seamless Synchronization**: Automatically distribute container environments (as tarballs) to runners without manual setup on each node.
- **Familiar Workflow**: Submit tasks through a simple interface that feels like running a command or launching an environment on your local machine.

> **Key Insight**: Docker in HakuRiver functions more like a virtual environment (like Python's venv or conda) that can be dynamically adjusted and automatically synchronized across nodes.

## System Components

HakuRiver consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Host Server** (`hakuriver.host`):
   - Central coordinator that manages nodes and tasks.
   - Provides APIs for task submission and monitoring.
   - Manages Docker environments and tarballs.
   - Maintains the system database (SQLite).
   - Runs the **SSH proxy server** for VPS task access.
   - Serves the optional web dashboard.

2. **Runner Agents** (`hakuriver.runner`):
   - Run on each compute node.
   - Execute tasks within Docker containers or via systemd.
   - Automatically sync container environments from shared storage.
   - Monitor and report resource usage (including **GPU info**) back to the Host.

3. **Client Tools**:
   - `hakuriver.client` - General commands: list nodes, get health, check status, kill/pause/resume *any* task by ID.
   - `hakuriver.task` - Submit **command tasks**.
   - `hakuriver.vps` - Submit and list **VPS tasks**.
   - `hakuriver.ssh` - Connect to a **running VPS task** via the Host proxy.
   - `hakuriver.docker` - Manage Docker environments on the Host.
   - `hakuriver.docker-shell` - Interactive shell access to Host containers.
   - `hakurun` - Local argument spanning utility for parameter sweeps.

4. **Web Dashboard** (Optional):
   - Provides visualization of nodes (including **GPU status**), tasks, and resources.
   - Allows task submission (including **VPS**) through a graphical interface.
   - Monitors task status and logs.

## Key Features

*   **Managed Docker Environment Workflow** - Create, modify, and distribute reproducible environments.
*   **Containerized Task Execution** - Run command tasks in isolated, consistent Docker environments.
*   **VPS Tasks with SSH Access** - Launch persistent containers for interactive sessions via SSH, proxied through the Host.
*   **Automated Environment Synchronization** - Runners automatically fetch required container tarballs.
*   **Systemd Fallback Execution** - Option for *command tasks* to run directly on the node via `systemd-run`.
*   **CPU/RAM Resource Allocation** - Request specific amounts of CPU cores and memory limits for both command and VPS tasks.
*   **NUMA Node Targeting** - Optionally bind tasks to specific NUMA nodes (primarily for Systemd tasks).
*   **GPU Resource Allocation** - Request specific GPU devices for Docker and VPS tasks. Runners report available GPUs.
*   **Multi-Target Submission** - Submit a single request to run the same command task across multiple specified nodes, NUMA nodes, or GPU sets. VPS tasks target a single node/NUMA/GPU set or use auto-selection.
*   **Persistent Task & Node Records** - Track status, resources, logs, container used, and SSH port (for VPS) in a central database.
*   **Node Health & Resource Awareness** - Runners report detailed resource usage, including NUMA topology and GPU details.
*   **Web Dashboard** - Visual monitoring, submission, and management, including dedicated **GPU** and **VPS Tasks** views.
*   **Task Control** - Pause and Resume running tasks (where supported by execution method).
*   **`hakurun` Utility** - Local helper for argument spanning.

## When to Use HakuRiver

HakuRiver is ideal for:

- Research labs with multiple computers for data processing, simulations, or analysis.
- Small teams needing to distribute computational tasks or provide on-demand compute environments across available machines.
- Home lab setups where you want to utilize all your machines efficiently.
- Development environments where reproducibility and consistent environments are crucial.

It's particularly well-suited for distributing **command-line tasks** and providing **interactive VPS sessions** that benefit from containerized environments, such as data processing scripts, simulations, machine learning training, and batch processing.
