# Systemd Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate HakuRiver Host and Runner components with systemd to ensure reliable operation, automatic startup on boot, and proper service management. Running HakuRiver components as system services is recommended for production environments.

## Introduction to systemd

systemd is the standard service manager for most modern Linux distributions. It provides:

-   Automatic service startup on boot.
-   Dependency management (e.g., starting after the network or Docker).
-   Service monitoring and automatic restart on failure.
-   Centralized logging via journald.
-   Basic resource control for services.
-   Management of transient scopes for applications (`systemd-run --scope`).

HakuRiver provides a built-in tool (`hakuriver.init service`) to generate basic systemd service files for both Host and Runner components.

## Creating Service Files

The `hakuriver.init service` command generates a `.service` file based on your current environment and HakuRiver configuration.

```bash
hakuriver.init service [--host | --runner | --all] [--config PATH] [--host-config PATH] [--runner-config PATH] [--output-dir DIR]
```

### Options:

-   `--host`: Create service file for the Host component (`hakuriver-host.service`).
-   `--runner`: Create service file for the Runner component (`hakuriver-runner.service`).
-   `--all`: Create service files for both Host and Runner.
-   `--config PATH`: Specify a single custom configuration file used for *both* host and runner service generation (if both are selected).
-   `--host-config PATH`: Specify a custom configuration file specifically for the Host service. Overrides `--config` if both are used for Host.
-   `--runner-config PATH`: Specify a custom configuration file specifically for the Runner service. Overrides `--config` if both are used for Runner.
-   `--output-dir DIR`: Directory to write the generated service file(s) to (default: current directory `.` where you run the command).

After generating, you typically need to move the file(s) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and reload the systemd daemon.

## Setting Up the Host Service

### Generating and Installing the Host Service File

Run this command on the **Host node**:

```bash
# Generate service file in the current directory
hakuriver.init service --host [--config /path/to/host.toml]

# Review the generated file (optional)
cat hakuriver-host.service

# Move the service file to the systemd system directory
sudo cp hakuriver-host.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Reload systemd daemon to pick up the new file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Default Host Service Content

The generated `hakuriver-host.service` file will look similar to this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HakuRiver Host Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<user_who_ran_hakuriver.init> # User executing the service
Group=<group_of_user>             # Group executing the service
WorkingDirectory=<shared_dir>     # Set to the shared_dir from config
ExecStart=<python_path> -m hakuriver.cli.host --config <config_path> # Path to python executable and config
Restart=on-failure                # Restart if the process exits with a non-zero code
RestartSec=5                      # Wait 5 seconds before restarting
Environment="PATH=<venv_bin_path>:<system_path>" # Ensure HakuRiver is in PATH

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target        # Start the service when the system reaches multi-user state
```
The `<python_path>`, `<shared_dir>`, `<config_path>`, and `Environment="PATH=..."` will be automatically filled based on the environment where you ran `hakuriver.init service --host`. Ensure these paths are correct and accessible from the context of the systemd service.

### Customizing the Host Service

You may want to modify the service file for your specific environment or requirements (e.g., different user, resource limits, explicit dependencies). Use `sudo systemctl edit hakuriver-host.service` to create an override file without modifying the original.

Common customizations:

-   **User/Group**: Change `User=` and `Group=` to a dedicated system user (recommended for security). Ensure this user has permissions to access the database file, shared directory, and Docker socket.
-   **Dependencies**: Add `After=docker.service` if the Host relies on Docker being fully started (although the Host's Docker interactions are mostly independent of tasks).
-   **Resource Limits**: Add properties like `CPUQuota=`, `MemoryMax=` to limit the resources the Host process itself can consume.
-   **Environment Variables**: Add `Environment="KEY=VALUE"` or `EnvironmentFile=/path/to/env_file` for additional variables needed by the Host process.

## Setting Up Runner Services

### Generating and Installing the Runner Service File

Run this command on **each Runner node**:

```bash
# Generate service file in the current directory
hakuriver.init service --runner [--config /path/to/runner.toml]

# Review the generated file (optional)
cat hakuriver-runner.service

# Move the service file to the systemd system directory
sudo cp hakuriver-runner.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Reload systemd daemon
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Default Runner Service Content

The generated `hakuriver-runner.service` file will look similar to this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HakuRiver Runner Agent
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<user_who_ran_hakuriver.init> # User executing the service
Group=<group_of_user>             # Group executing the service
WorkingDirectory=<shared_dir>     # Set to the shared_dir from config
ExecStart=<python_path> -m hakuriver.cli.runner --config <config_path> # Path to python executable and config
Restart=on-failure                # Restart if the process exits with a non-zero code
RestartSec=5                      # Wait 5 seconds before restarting
Environment="PATH=<venv_bin_path>:<system_path>" # Ensure HakuRiver is in PATH

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target        # Start the service when the system reaches multi-user state
```
Ensure `<python_path>`, `<shared_dir>`, `<config_path>`, and `Environment="PATH=..."` are correct for the Runner's environment.

### Customizing the Runner Service

Customize the Runner service (using `sudo systemctl edit hakuriver-runner.service`) for dependencies, permissions, or resources.

Common customizations:

-   **Dependencies**: Add `After=docker.service` and `Requires=docker.service` to ensure the Runner only starts after the Docker daemon is ready, as Docker is essential for Runner functionality. Add `After=network-online.target` for network filesystems.
-   **User/Group**: Change `User=` and `Group=` to a dedicated system user (recommended). This user **must** have permissions to access the Docker daemon and execute commands with `sudo` for the systemd fallback (`systemd-run`, `systemctl`) and potentially `numactl`.
-   **Resource Limits**: Limit the Runner process itself (separate from tasks it launches).
-   **Environment Variables**: Ensure any required environment variables for the Runner are set (e.g., `PATH` includes directories for `docker`, `systemd-run`, `numactl` if not in default system locations).

## Managing Services

Use standard `systemctl` commands to manage the Host and Runner services:

### Starting and Enabling Services

To start services immediately and enable them to start automatically on boot:

```bash
# On Host
sudo systemctl start hakuriver-host.service
sudo systemctl enable hakuriver-host.service

# On each Runner
sudo systemctl start hakuriver-runner.service
sudo systemctl enable hakuriver-runner.service
```

### Checking Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status hakuriver-host.service
sudo systemctl status hakuriver-runner.service
```

### Restarting Services

```bash
sudo systemctl restart hakuriver-host.service
sudo systemctl restart hakuriver-runner.service
```

### Stopping Services

```bash
sudo systemctl stop hakuriver-host.service
sudo systemctl stop hakuriver-runner.service
```

## Viewing Logs

systemd logs service output (stdout and stderr) to the journal. Use `journalctl` to view logs:

```bash
# View logs for the Host service
sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service

# View logs for a specific Runner service
sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service

# Follow logs in real-time (-f for follow)
sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service -f

# Show logs since the last service start
sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service --since "service hakuriver-host start"

# Show logs from a specific time period
sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service --since "1 hour ago" --until "now"
```
If you configured `host_log_file` or `runner_log_file` in your `config.toml`, logs might also be directed to those files in addition to (or instead of, depending on systemd configuration) the journal.

## Multiple Runner Instances on One Machine (Advanced)

If you need to run multiple distinct Runner instances on a single physical machine:

1.  Create separate configuration files for each instance, ensuring unique `runner_address` (if multiple network interfaces are available) and `runner_port`. Example: `~/.hakuriver/runner1.toml`, `~/.hakuriver/runner2.toml`.
2.  Generate separate service files for each instance using the `--config` flag:
    ```bash
    hakuriver.init service --runner --config ~/.hakuriver/runner1.toml --output-dir .
    mv hakuriver-runner.service hakuriver-runner1.service # Rename the output

    hakuriver.init service --runner --config ~/.hakuriver/runner2.toml --output-dir .
    mv hakuriver-runner.service hakuriver-runner2.service # Rename the output
    ```
3.  Copy all generated service files to `/etc/systemd/system/`.
4.  Reload systemd daemon: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
5.  Start and enable each service instance:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now hakuriver-runner1.service
    sudo systemctl enable --now hakuriver-runner2.service
    ```
Ensure the Runner configuration (`runner_address`, `runner_port`) uniquely identifies each instance for the Host.

## Service Dependencies

It's good practice to add dependencies to service files using `After=` and `Requires=` to ensure components start in the correct order.

-   **Runner requiring Network and Docker**:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=HakuRiver Runner Agent
    After=network-online.target docker.service # Wait for network and Docker
    Requires=docker.service                   # Docker is mandatory
    ```

## Task Execution with systemd

HakuRiver Runners use `systemd-run --scope` to execute **Command Tasks** when `--container NULL` is specified in the task submission. This creates a temporary systemd scope unit for the task's process(es).

```bash
# Example submission using systemd fallback
hakuriver.task submit --target node1 --container NULL -- df -h /
```

The Runner constructs and executes a `sudo systemd-run --scope` command, which might look something like this (simplified):

```bash
sudo systemd-run --scope --collect \
  --property=User=runner_username \
  --property=CPUQuota=200% \
  --property=MemoryMax=4G \
  --unit=hakuriver-task-12345 \
  --description="HakuRiver Task 12345: df" \
  --working-directory=/path/to/shared/data \
  /bin/sh -c 'exec numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 df -h / > /path/to/logs/12345.out 2> /path/to/logs/12345.err'
```
The specific properties, working directory, and command wrapping depend on the task request and runner configuration (e.g., cores, memory, NUMA target, environment variables, stdout/stderr paths).

### Configuring systemd Task Execution

For the systemd fallback execution mode to work correctly on a Runner:

1.  **`systemd-run` executable:** Ensure the `systemd-container` or equivalent package is installed to provide `systemd-run`.
2.  **Sudo Permissions:** The user running the `hakuriver.runner` service must have passwordless `sudo` access to execute `systemd-run` and potentially `systemctl` (used for checking/killing units) as the user specified in the `runner_user` config setting (or the runner user itself if `runner_user` is empty). Configure this in `/etc/sudoers` using `visudo` (see Runner Setup).
3.  **`numactl` (Optional):** If using NUMA targeting (`--target node:numa_id`) with systemd tasks, ensure `numactl` is installed and its path is correctly set in the Runner's `config.toml`. If `runner_user` is used, this user may also need `sudo` access to `numactl` or `numactl` might need to be run within the systemd scope executed as root (less common). The runner currently prepends `numactl` with `sudo` if `runner_user` is different from the runner process user.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

-   **Failed to start service:** Check `sudo systemctl status <service_name>` and `sudo journalctl -u <service_name>`. Verify the `ExecStart` path is correct, the user/group exists and has permissions to read the configuration file and `WorkingDirectory`.
-   **Configuration path issues:** Ensure absolute paths are used in service files or that the `WorkingDirectory` is set correctly and the config path is relative to it. Verify the config file exists and is readable by the service user.
-   **Dependency failures:** Check `sudo systemctl status <service_name>` for dependency errors. Ensure required services (`docker`, `network-online.target`) are active and running.
-   **Permissions for task execution (Systemd fallback):** If `--container NULL` tasks fail with permission errors, check the `sudo visudo` configuration for the runner user and the permissions on shared/local directories.
-   **`systemd-run` or `numactl` command not found within service:** Ensure the `PATH` environment variable in the service file includes the directories where these executables are located, or use absolute paths in the Runner code (HakuRiver attempts this).

## Best Practices

1.  **Use Dedicated Users**: Run Host and Runner services under dedicated, unprivileged system users for better isolation.
2.  **Secure Sudo**: Use `visudo` and grant only necessary `NOPASSWD` permissions (e.g., only for `systemd-run`, `systemctl` status/stop/kill/is-active, `docker` commands if not in docker group).
3.  **Set Resource Limits**: Define appropriate resource limits (`CPUQuota`, `MemoryMax`) in service files to prevent services (Host or Runner itself) from consuming all system resources.
4.  **Log Management**: Ensure logs are directed to the journal and configure log rotation for journald or specific log files if used.
5.  **Enable Service Accounting**: Use `CPUAccounting=true MemoryAccounting=true` in service files to enable resource usage tracking for the service itself (separate from the tasks it runs).
6.  **Service Hardening**: Consider advanced systemd hardening directives (`ProtectSystem`, `ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp`, `NoNewPrivileges`, `CapabilityBoundingSet`, `SystemCallFilter`) for sensitive environments, but be cautious as this can break functionality if misconfigured.

## Next Steps

After setting up HakuRiver with systemd:

1.  Review and implement comprehensive [Security Measures](5. security.md) for your deployment.
2.  Set up external monitoring for systemd services for alerting on failures.
3.  Test task execution thoroughly, including different execution methods (`--container <name>`, `--container NULL`), resource requests, and targets (nodes, NUMA, GPUs).
