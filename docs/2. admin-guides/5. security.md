# Security Guide

This guide covers security considerations and recommendations for deploying HakuRiver in a secure environment. While HakuRiver is designed for small to medium research clusters rather than multi-tenant, high-security production environments, implementing appropriate security measures is still important.

## Security Model Overview

HakuRiver operates on a trust-based model where:

-   The Host is the central authority.
-   Runners are trusted agents executing code from the Host.
-   Clients are trusted users submitting tasks to the Host.
-   All components share a common storage system.
-   Authentication between components is minimal or non-existent by default, relying primarily on network access control.

This model is appropriate for research labs, small teams, or home labs where all nodes and users are under unified administrative control within a trusted network. For environments with untrusted users or external exposure, additional security measures beyond the default HakuRiver features are necessary.

## Network Security

### Network Topology

Consider implementing a tiered or segmented network structure to limit the blast radius in case of a compromise:

1.  **Management/Control Network**: For Host-Runner API communication (`host_port`, `runner_port`). Ideally restrict access to only Host and Runner IPs.
2.  **Storage Network**: For shared storage access (`shared_dir`). Should be isolated from external networks if possible.
3.  **Client Access Network**: For users accessing the Host API (`host_port`), Web Dashboard (if separate), and the Host SSH proxy (`host_ssh_proxy_port`). Can be exposed to your user network, but should be restricted externally.

### Firewall Configuration

Strictly control network access to HakuRiver components using firewalls (`ufw`, `firewalld`, etc.).

**Host Node**:
```bash
# Allow incoming connections only from trusted networks/IPs:
# Allow Host API (from Runners and Clients)
sudo ufw allow from <runner_network/ip> to any port <host_port> proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from <client_network/ip> to any port <host_port> proto tcp
# Allow SSH Proxy (from Clients)
sudo ufw allow from <client_network/ip> to any port <host_ssh_proxy_port> proto tcp
# Allow SSH for administration
sudo ufw allow ssh
# If serving dashboard directly from Host (consider a separate web server):
# sudo ufw allow from <client_network/ip> to any port 80 proto tcp   # HTTP
# sudo ufw allow from <client_network/ip> to any port 443 proto tcp # HTTPS
# Deny other incoming traffic by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing # Adjust if strict egress control is needed
sudo ufw enable
```

**Runner Nodes**:
```bash
# Allow incoming connections only from the Host
# Allow Runner API (from Host)
sudo ufw allow from <host_ip_address> to any port <runner_port> proto tcp
# Allow SSH for administration
sudo ufw allow ssh
# Deny other incoming by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing # Adjust if strict egress control is needed
sudo ufw enable
```

### Network Access Control

Beyond port filtering, use firewall rules to restrict sources. E.g., only allow connections to `runner_port` (default 8001) from the Host's IP address.

## Authentication and Authorization

By default, HakuRiver has minimal built-in authentication between Host, Runners, and Clients. The API endpoints are generally unprotected under the assumption of a trusted network.

-   **Internal API Security**: For increased security in non-fully-trusted internal networks, you could implement a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) in front of the Host and Runner APIs that enforces authentication (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, Mutual TLS) for internal communication.
-   **Web Dashboard Security**: The optional web dashboard should **never** be exposed directly to the public internet without strong authentication (e.g., using a reverse proxy with password protection, OAuth, or integrating with an identity provider). HTTPS is essential for the dashboard to protect credentials and data in transit.
-   **Client Authentication**: The CLI tools do not authenticate to the Host by default. Anyone with network access to the Host API can submit tasks, kill tasks, etc. In a sensitive environment, this would need to be addressed by placing the Host API behind an authenticated gateway or VPN.

## Docker Security

HakuRiver uses Docker containers for task execution and VPS sessions, which requires careful security considerations.

### Container Privilege Controls

-   **`--privileged` flag**: The `[docker] tasks_privileged` configuration defaults to `false`, and the `--privileged` flag on task submission should be used with extreme caution. A privileged container has nearly unlimited access to the host system's devices and kernel features. **Only enable this if absolutely necessary for specific tasks and understand the risks.**
-   **Capability Dropping/Adding**: By default, Docker containers run with a reduced set of Linux capabilities. HakuRiver adds `SYS_NICE` for better process priority management, but otherwise relies on Docker's defaults. For more restrictive environments, you could configure Runners to drop more capabilities by default.

### Docker Socket Protection

The Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) grants root-level access to anyone who can connect to it.

-   Ensure only the user running the `hakuriver.runner` service is in the `docker` group.
-   Consider running the Docker daemon in rootless mode if your distribution supports it and your use case allows.

### Image Security

-   **Use Trusted Images**: Start with official Docker images from trusted sources (Docker Hub, your own secure registry).
-   **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine, slim variants) to reduce the attack surface.
-   **Build Process**: Define your environment setup in clear steps (e.g., a `Dockerfile` or a script run via `hakuriver.docker-shell`). Minimize the number of unnecessary tools or services installed.
-   **Scan Images**: Regularly scan the HakuRiver base images you create for known vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Docker Scout.
-   **Keep Images Updated**: Periodically rebuild your HakuRiver base images from updated standard images to incorporate security patches.

### Container Resource Limits

Always specify resource limits (`--cores`, `--memory`) for your tasks. While these primarily prevent tasks from starving the node, they also offer some protection against malicious tasks attempting denial-of-service by consuming excessive resources. The Runner applies these limits using Docker's `--cpus` and `--memory` flags.

## File and Storage Security

### Shared Storage Permissions

The shared storage is accessed by potentially multiple users (the Host user, the Runner user, and the user tasks run as).

-   Configure permissions on the shared directory and its subdirectories (`container_dir`, `task_outputs`, `task_errors`, `shared_data`) using standard Linux filesystem permissions (`chown`, `chmod`).
-   Grant read/write permissions only where necessary. For example, task output directories need to be writable by the Runner user, but other directories might only need read access.
-   Be mindful of the `umask` setting for the user running the Runner service, as it affects the default permissions of newly created files (like logs).

### Secure Protocols

Use secure protocols for accessing shared storage (e.g., NFSv4 with Kerberos, SMB3 with encryption) if operating outside a fully trusted physical network segment.

## User and Service Security

### Dedicated System Users

Run HakuRiver Host and Runner components under dedicated, unprivileged system users rather than `root` or a standard user account.

1.  Create users: `sudo useradd --system --no-create-home hakuriver-host --shell /sbin/nologin` (and similar for runner).
2.  Configure systemd services to run under these users (`User=`, `Group=` directives).
3.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to these users (e.g., read access to config, read/write access to logs/db/shared dir, access to Docker socket, specific sudo rules).

### Least Privilege Principle

Apply the principle of least privilege strictly:

-   **Sudo Permissions**: If the Runner user requires `sudo` for `systemd-run`, `systemctl`, or `docker`, use `visudo` to grant `NOPASSWD` only for the absolute minimum required commands and arguments. Avoid granting `NOPASSWD: ALL`.
-   **Runner User for Tasks**: Use the `[environment] runner_user` configuration option to specify a less privileged user for executing tasks via systemd fallback if the Runner service must run as a user with broader permissions (like being in the `docker` group). Ensure the `runner_user` has appropriate permissions on shared/local directories.

### Systemd Service Hardening

Harden the systemd service units for Host and Runner with security directives where possible and compatible with HakuRiver's operation.

```ini
[Service]
# Filesystem access restrictions (adjust paths as needed)
# ProtectSystem=strict   # May break if HakuRiver needs to write outside allowed paths
# ProtectHome=read-only  # May break if HakuRiver user's home is involved in config loading etc.
PrivateTmp=true          # Recommended: provides a private /tmp for the service
ReadOnlyPaths=/etc/hakuriver # Example: only read config
ReadWritePaths=/var/log/hakuriver /opt/hakuriver/ /mnt/hakuriver-shared # Example: allow writing to logs/db/shared

# Execution environment restrictions
NoNewPrivileges=true    # Prevents gaining new privileges
# CapabilityBoundingSet= # Restrict capabilities (advanced, requires careful analysis)
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectControlGroups=true

# System call restrictions (advanced, requires careful testing)
# SystemCallFilter=...
```

## Monitoring and Audit

### Logging and Audit

Configure comprehensive logging for Host and Runner processes via systemd journald. Set up log forwarding to a central log server for better security analysis and retention.

-   Monitor logs for signs of unauthorized access attempts, unusual activity, or repeated errors that might indicate attacks or misconfigurations.

### System Monitoring

Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) and running processes on Host and Runner nodes. Alert on unusual spikes or unexpected processes. File integrity monitoring (FIM) tools like AIDE can detect unauthorized changes to HakuRiver binaries or configuration files.

## Task Execution Security

### Input Validation

While HakuRiver does not perform deep validation of task commands or arguments, be aware that users submitting tasks can execute arbitrary commands within the container environment (or on the host via systemd fallback).

-   Limit access to task submission APIs (via network controls or authentication methods discussed above).
-   If exposing submission to less trusted users, consider implementing stricter validation or sandboxing within the task execution mechanism (beyond standard Docker/systemd isolation).

### Container Isolation

Docker provides process, filesystem, and network isolation by default.

-   Avoid `--privileged` unless absolutely necessary.
-   Be aware that network=host (used by default for command tasks) removes network isolation. If network isolation is critical, configure custom Docker networks.
-   Understand the limitations of Docker isolation, particularly regarding kernel vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks in multi-tenant scenarios (though HakuRiver is not designed for multi-tenancy).

### VPS Task Security

VPS tasks grant interactive shell access (typically as `root` by default) inside a container on a Runner node.

-   **Public Key Authentication**: Always require SSH public key authentication. **Never** enable password authentication for VPS tasks.
-   **Container Hardening**: Ensure the Docker image used for VPS tasks is hardened: minimal services, up-to-date packages, locked-down SSH server configuration (`PermitRootLogin no` is safer if possible, but HakuRiver defaults to root key injection, so requires `yes`).
-   **User Management**: If possible, configure the container environment to run the SSH daemon for a non-root user.
-   **Resource Limits**: Crucial for VPS tasks to prevent a user from consuming all resources on a node.
-   **Monitoring**: Monitor active VPS sessions on nodes and logs for suspicious activity within the container.

## Next Steps

After implementing core HakuRiver setup:

1.  Apply relevant network firewall rules.
2.  Secure the Web Dashboard (if used).
3.  Implement user and service security best practices (dedicated users, limited sudo).
4.  Review Docker security practices for creating and running containers.
5.  Pay particular attention to the security implications and hardening steps for VPS tasks.
