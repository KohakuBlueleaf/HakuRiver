# Docker Management via the Web Dashboard

The HakuRiver Web Dashboard provides a graphical interface for managing your Host-side Docker containers and viewing the container tarballs available in shared storage. This is part of the [Docker Container Workflow](../1. container-workflow.md).

## Accessing the Docker View

Navigate to the "Docker" section in the Web Dashboard sidebar. This view is divided into two main tabs: "Host Containers" and "Shared Tarballs".

## Host Containers Tab

This tab allows you to manage the persistent Docker containers that reside on the HakuRiver Host machine. These containers are used as your "master copies" for installing software and preparing environments before packaging them into tarballs.

-   **Container List**: A table lists all Docker containers detected on the Host. For containers managed by HakuRiver (created via `hakuriver.docker create-container`), it shows their name, image, and current status (Running, Stopped, etc.).
-   **Status Tags**: The container status is shown with a color-coded tag (Green for Running, Blue/Grey for Stopped/Created).

### Actions

Available actions for each container (depending on its status):

-   **Start**: Starts a stopped container.
-   **Stop**: Stops a running container.
-   **Create Tar**: Triggers the process to commit the current state of this container and create a new, timestamped tarball in `shared_dir/container_dir/`. This is how you package your environment for Runners.
-   **Shell**: Opens a web-based interactive terminal session directly into the *running* container. This is used to customize the environment (install software, configure settings).
-   **Delete**: Removes the container from the Host machine. This does NOT delete the tarballs previously created from it in shared storage.

### Creating a New Host Container

Click the "Create New Container" button to open a modal form:
-   **Docker Image Name**: Enter the name of the public Docker image to pull and create the container from (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `python:3.11-slim`, `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu`).
-   **HakuRiver Container Name**: Enter the desired name for this environment within HakuRiver (e.g., `my-dev-env`, `my-cuda-env`). This name will be used when creating tarballs and submitting tasks (`--container NAME`).
-   Click "Create". The dashboard will show a confirmation message. The new container should appear in the list shortly.

### Using the Interactive Shell

Click the "Shell" button for a *running* container to open a terminal modal:
-   A web-based terminal appears, connected directly to a shell inside the container on the Host.
-   You can run commands here to customize the environment (e.g., `apt update && apt install -y ...`, `pip install ...`, configure files for SSH setup if preparing a VPS image).
-   Type `exit` to close the shell session.

## Shared Tarballs Tab

This tab shows the HakuRiver container tarball files (`<name>-<timestamp>.tar`) that are stored in the configured `shared_dir/container_dir/`. These are the files that Runner nodes automatically download and load to get the task execution environments.

-   **Tarball List**: A table lists the container environments found in shared storage.
-   **Latest Version**: Shows the timestamp and filename of the most recent tarball for each environment name.
-   **All Versions (Expandable)**: Expand a row to see a list of all tarball versions available for that container name, sorted by timestamp (newest first).

### Actions

-   Currently, deleting specific tarball versions is not fully implemented in the Web UI. Manual cleanup might be needed on the shared storage filesystem if you need to remove old versions beyond what HakuRiver automatically prunes when creating new tars.
-   You can trigger a refresh of the list using the refresh button.

## Workflow Integration

The Docker view integrates with the task submission process:
-   When submitting a Command or VPS task, the "Container Environment" dropdown lists the names of the environments found in the "Shared Tarballs" tab.
-   You prepare environments in the "Host Containers" tab, then package them using "Create Tar" to make them available in the "Shared Tarballs" tab and thus selectable for tasks.

## Next Steps

-   Prepare your [Container Images](../1. container-workflow.md) using the workflow shown here.
-   Submit [Command Tasks](../2. command-tasks/1. submission.md) or [VPS Tasks](../3. vps-tasks/1. management.md) using the environments you've packaged.
-   Review the [Docker CLI Reference](../4. reference/3. task-commands.md) for equivalent command-line actions.
