# Web Dashboard Guide

HakuRiver includes an optional web dashboard that provides a graphical interface for monitoring, submitting, and managing your cluster, including detailed views for nodes, **GPUs**, and **VPS tasks**. This guide explains how to set up and use the dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The HakuRiver dashboard offers a visual interface with these key features:

-   **Cluster Overview**: High-level summary of node status and resource utilization.
-   **Node Monitoring**: Detailed node information, including CPU, memory, and NUMA topology.
-   **GPU Monitoring**: Dedicated view for tracking GPU status, utilization, and temperature across nodes.
-   **Task Management**: Submit, monitor, and control **Command tasks**.
-   **VPS Task Management**: List and manage **VPS tasks**, including viewing their SSH ports.
-   **Docker Container Management**: View and manage Host-side Docker environments and shared tarballs.
-   **Resource Visualization**: Track cluster resource utilization over time.
-   **Log Viewing**: Examine task output logs directly in the browser.

## Setting Up the Dashboard

The dashboard is a Vue.js single-page application (SPA) that connects to the HakuRiver Host API via HTTP and WebSockets.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on the machine where you will build the frontend assets.
-   A running HakuRiver Host server accessible from the machine serving the dashboard.

### Development Setup

For development or quick testing, you can run the dashboard in development mode. This requires Node.js on the machine where you run the dev server.

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory in the HakuRiver source code.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Start the Vite development server: `npm run dev`.
4.  Open your browser to the URL provided by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

The development server includes a proxy configuration (`vite.config.js`) that forwards requests to `/api` to the configured Host address (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

### Production Deployment

For a production setup, you build static assets and serve them using a standard web server (like Nginx, Apache, or Caddy).

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2.  Build optimized static files: `npm run build`. This creates the `frontend/dist/` directory.
3.  Copy the contents of `frontend/dist/` to the webroot directory of your web server.
4.  **Crucially**, configure your web server to **proxy requests** that start with `/api/` to your running HakuRiver Host address and port (`http://<host_bind_ip>:<host_port>`). This proxy configuration must also support **WebSocket proxying** for the interactive terminal feature in the Docker view.

Example Nginx configuration snippet for proxying (assuming Host runs on `localhost:8000`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80; # Or 443 for HTTPS
    server_name your_dashboard_hostname.com; # Replace with your domain/IP

    # Root directory where you copied frontend/dist contents
    root /var/www/your_dashboard_path;
    index index.html;

    # Serve the static files, handle client-side routing (SPA)
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Proxy API and WebSocket requests to the HakuRiver Host
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/; # Replace with your Host's bind address and port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; # Enable WebSocket proxying
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";  # Enable WebSocket proxying
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        # Add other proxy headers as needed
    }
}
```
For a production deployment, using HTTPS for the dashboard is highly recommended.

## Using the Dashboard

Access the dashboard by navigating to its URL in your web browser. The interface is divided into several key views accessible from the sidebar.

### Dashboard Home

Provides a high-level overview:
-   Summary statistics for nodes (total, online, offline).
-   Cluster-wide resource utilization (CPU, Memory), including current usage and historical graphs.
-   Summary counts of tasks by status (Running, Pending, Completed, Failed, etc.).

### Nodes View

Lists all registered compute nodes and their current status and resources.
-   See hostname, status, core count, memory, CPU/Memory utilization.
-   Includes a column for NUMA Nodes count and Allocated resources (cores, memory) based on running/pending tasks.
-   Clicking on a node row typically reveals more detailed information, including its reported NUMA topology.

![Nodes View](../../image/README/1745625516131.png)
*Example: Nodes List*

### GPU View

A dedicated view focused on GPU resources reported by Runner nodes.
-   Lists each node that has reported GPU information.
-   For each node, it lists individual GPUs by ID.
-   Displays GPU name, driver version, and real-time metrics like GPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Temperature, and Power usage.
-   This view is essential for monitoring your GPU resources and identifying available GPUs for task submission.

![GPU View](../../image/README/1745625528455.png)
*Example: GPU Info List*

### Tasks Workflow (Command Tasks)

The "Tasks" section is primarily for managing **Command tasks**.

#### Task List

Browse all command tasks submitted to the cluster:
-   Task ID, Command, Arguments preview.
-   Status, Assigned Node, Required Cores, Target NUMA.
-   Submission time.

![Command Task List](../../image/README/1745625541004.png)
*Example: Command Task List*

#### Task Submission Form

Submit a new command task using a graphical form:
-   Enter command and arguments.
-   Specify required CPU cores and memory limit.
-   Select the Container Environment (or Systemd fallback).
-   Select one or more targets (Nodes, NUMA nodes).
-   **Includes GPU selection:** If the GPU feature is enabled, you can select specific GPUs on available nodes instead of standard targets.
-   Optional fields for environment variables, additional mounts, and privileged mode.

![Command Task Submission Form](../../image/README/1745625554460.png)
*Example: Command Task Submission Form*

#### Task Details

Click on a task in the list to open a dialog with full details:
-   Complete command, arguments, environment variables.
-   Assigned node, status, exit code, error message.
-   Submitted, started, and completed timestamps.
-   **Log Viewer**: Access standard output and error logs in real-time (for running tasks) or view final logs (for completed/failed tasks).

![Command Task Details and Logs](../../image/README/1745625574031.png) ![Command Task Logs Modal](../../image/README/1745625583209.png)
*Examples: Command Task Details Dialog and Logs Modal*

#### Task Actions

From the Task Details dialog or sometimes directly in the list, you can perform actions:
-   **Kill**: Terminate a running or pending task.
-   **Pause/Resume**: Pause or resume a running task (if supported by the execution method).

### VPS Tasks Workflow

The "VPS" section provides management for **VPS tasks**.

#### Active VPS Task List

Lists VPS tasks that are currently in an active state (pending, assigning, running, paused):
-   Task ID, Status, Assigned Node, Required Resources.
-   Submitted/Started Timestamps.
-   **SSH Port**: The dynamically assigned port on the Runner for SSH access is clearly displayed here for running VPS tasks.

![Active VPS Task List](../../image/README/1746178499670.png)
*Example: Task List layout (similar for VPS)*

#### VPS Task Submission Form

Submit a new VPS task using a graphical form:
-   Paste or upload your SSH public key (`.pub` file).
-   Specify required CPU cores and optional memory limit.
-   Select the Container Environment (must be a Docker container with SSH installed).
-   Select a single target (Node, NUMA node, or specific GPUs on one node), or leave blank for auto-selection by the Host based on requested resources.
-   Optional fields for additional mounts and privileged mode.

![VPS Task Submission Form](../../image/README/1746178521397.png)
*Example: Task Submission form layout (similar for VPS)*

#### VPS Task Actions

From the VPS Tasks list or details (if a detail view exists):
-   **Kill**: Stop the VPS container.
-   **Pause/Resume**: Pause or resume the VPS container (`docker pause`/`unpause`).

Connecting to a VPS task using `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>` is done via the CLI, not directly from the web UI.

### Docker Workflow (Host-side)

The "Docker" section lets you manage the persistent Docker containers on the Host used for environment preparation and view the generated tarballs in shared storage.

#### Host Containers and Tarballs

-   List persistent containers on the Host: See name, image, and status.
-   Create new containers from public images.
-   Start/Stop/Delete containers.
-   **Create Tar**: Trigger the process to commit a container's state and create a tarball in shared storage.
-   List available container tarballs in shared storage, grouped by name with timestamps.

![Host Containers and Tarballs](../../image/README/1745625595530.png)
*Example: Docker Container List*

#### Interactive Container Shell

Access a web-based terminal directly into a running Host container:
-   From the Host Containers list, click "Shell" for a running container.
-   A terminal modal opens, allowing you to run commands (e.g., `apt-get install`, `pip install`) to customize the environment before creating a tarball.

## Dashboard Features

-   **Real-time Monitoring**: Many views auto-refresh periodically to show current status and resource usage.
-   **Log Streaming**: For running Command tasks, logs update in real-time in the details modal.
-   **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be usable on various screen sizes.
-   **Search and Filtering**: Task lists often include search and filtering options.

## Browser Compatibility

The dashboard is developed with modern web standards and should be compatible with recent versions of major web browsers.

## Mobile Support

The dashboard is responsive and functional on mobile devices, though complex forms and the interactive terminal might be more cumbersome on small screens.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Dashboard cannot connect to API**: Check the Host server is running, verify network connectivity, and ensure your web server proxy configuration (for `/api/` and WebSocket) is correct.
-   **Missing data in tables/charts**: Check the logs of the Host and Runner nodes. Ensure Runners are online and sending heartbeats (`hakuriver.client nodes`, `hakuriver.client health`).

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md) for more general issues.

## Next Steps

-   Explore [Command Task Submission](../2. command-tasks/1. submission.md) via the form.
-   Submit and manage [VPS Tasks](../3. vps-tasks/1. management.md) using the VPS view.
-   Monitor [GPU Allocation](../4. gpu-allocation/1. allocation.md) and usage in the GPU view.
-   Use the Docker view to prepare container environments.
