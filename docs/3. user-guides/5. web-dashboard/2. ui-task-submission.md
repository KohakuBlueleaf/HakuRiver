# Submitting Tasks via the Web Dashboard

The HakuRiver Web Dashboard provides graphical forms for submitting both Command tasks and VPS tasks. This guide walks you through using these forms.

## Accessing the Submission Forms

Navigate to the Web Dashboard in your browser. The forms are typically found in:

-   **Command Tasks**: Go to the "Tasks" view and click the "Submit New Task" button.
-   **VPS Tasks**: Go to the "VPS" view and click the "Submit New VPS Task" button.

Both forms collect similar information but have key differences specific to task type.

## Submitting a Command Task (Web UI)

The Command Task submission form allows you to define a batch job or script execution.

1.  **Command**: Enter the executable path or command name (e.g., `/shared/scripts/my_script.sh`, `python`, `my_cli_tool`).
2.  **Arguments**: Enter each argument on a new line in the text area. Each non-empty line will be treated as a separate argument passed to the command.
3.  **Environment Variables**: Enter environment variables as `KEY=VALUE`, one per line. These will be set in the task's execution environment.
4.  **Required CPU Cores**: Enter the number of CPU cores the task instance requires.
5.  **Memory Limit (Optional)**: Enter the maximum memory the task instance is allowed to use (e.g., `512M`, `4G`).
6.  **Container Environment**: Select the HakuRiver container tarball environment to use from the dropdown list of available tarballs. You can also select "[Use Host Default]" or "[Systemd Fallback - No Docker]". Note that GPU allocation requires a Docker container (not Systemd fallback).
7.  **Enable GPU Selection (Toggle)**: A switch allows you to toggle between standard Node/NUMA targeting and GPU targeting.
    *   If **OFF**: Proceed to "Target Node(s) / NUMA Node(s)".
    *   If **ON**: Proceed to "Select Target GPUs".
8.  **Target Node(s) / NUMA Node(s)** (Visible when GPU Selection is OFF): Select one or more nodes from the dropdown. The options list available online nodes and their NUMA nodes. You can select multiple entries to submit the same task to multiple targets.
9.  **Select Target GPUs** (Visible when GPU Selection is ON): This section lists online nodes that report GPU information. Expand a node to see its GPUs and select the specific GPU IDs you want the task to use on that node. **For Command tasks, you can select GPUs on multiple nodes.** The form helps visualize GPU status. **Requires a Docker container.**
10. **Additional Mounts (Optional)**: Enter additional host-to-container bind mounts as `host_path:container_path`, one per line. Overrides default mounts.
11. **Run Privileged (Optional)**: Toggle the switch to run the Docker container in privileged mode. Use with extreme caution.
12. **Submit**: Click the submit button. The dashboard will show a confirmation message with the created task ID(s) or any submission errors.

## Submitting a VPS Task (Web UI)

The VPS Task submission form allows you to launch an interactive session.

1.  **SSH Public Key (.pub)**: Paste your public key string into the text area, OR use the "Select File" button to upload a `.pub` file. The content of the file will populate the text area. **A public key is required.**
2.  **Required CPU Cores**: Enter the number of CPU cores required. `0` usually means auto-select based on resource availability on the chosen node.
3.  **Memory Limit (Optional)**: Enter the maximum memory limit (e.g., `1G`, `2000M`).
4.  **Container Environment**: Select the HakuRiver container tarball environment to use. VPS tasks **require** a Docker container environment with an SSH server installed. The "Systemd Fallback" option is disabled.
5.  **Enable GPU Selection (Toggle)**: A switch allows you to toggle between standard Node/NUMA targeting and GPU targeting.
    *   If **OFF**: Proceed to "Target Node / NUMA Node".
    *   If **ON**: Proceed to "Select Target GPUs".
6.  **Target Node / NUMA Node** (Visible when GPU Selection is OFF): Select a single node or a node:numa\_id pair from the dropdown. You can also select "[Auto Select]" to let the Host choose a node based on resource requirements. **Only one target can be selected for a VPS task.**
7.  **Select Target GPUs** (Visible when GPU Selection is ON): This section lists online nodes that report GPU information. Expand a node to see its GPUs and select the specific GPU IDs you want the task to use on that node. **For VPS tasks, you can only select GPUs on a single node.** The form helps visualize GPU status. **Requires a Docker container.**
8.  **Additional Mounts (Optional)**: Enter additional host-to-container bind mounts as `host_path:container_path`, one per line.
9.  **Run Privileged (Optional)**: Toggle the switch for privileged mode.
10. **Submit**: Click the submit button. The dashboard will show a confirmation message with the created VPS task ID and its assigned SSH port (if immediately available), or any submission errors.

## Common Form Elements

-   **Loading Indicators**: Watch for loading spinners on dropdowns (Nodes, Containers) or the submit button, indicating data is being fetched or the request is being processed.
-   **Validation**: Forms use Element Plus validation rules. Required fields will be highlighted, and error messages will appear if the format is incorrect (e.g., memory string, target format).
-   **Tooltips**: Hover over info icons or truncated text for more details (e.g., full arguments, memory format examples).
-   **Error Messages**: Pay attention to alert boxes that appear at the top of the form or page if there are issues fetching data or submitting the task.
