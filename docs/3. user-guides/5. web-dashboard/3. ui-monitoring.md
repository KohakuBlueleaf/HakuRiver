# Monitoring with the Web Dashboard

The HakuRiver Web Dashboard provides several views to monitor the status of your cluster nodes, resources (including GPUs), and tasks (Command and VPS). This guide highlights the key monitoring features in the UI.

## Accessing Monitoring Views

After logging into the Web Dashboard, navigate using the sidebar:

-   **Dashboard (Home)**: For a high-level overview.
-   **Nodes**: For detailed node information.
-   **GPUs**: For a dedicated view of GPU status.
-   **Tasks**: For monitoring Command tasks.
-   **VPS**: For monitoring active VPS tasks.

## Dashboard Home View

The home page offers a quick summary of the cluster state:

-   **Node Count**: Shows the number of total and online nodes. Offline nodes are an immediate indicator of potential issues.
-   **Resource Utilization**: Displays current CPU and Memory usage across all *online* nodes as percentages. Includes mini-gauge charts for quick visualization.
-   **Resource History Charts**: Shows historical trends of aggregate CPU and Memory utilization (and Max/Avg CPU Temperature) over the last ~60 data points (typically 1 second intervals). Useful for seeing recent load patterns.
-   **Tasks Overview**: Provides counts of tasks by status (Running, Pending/Assigning, Completed, Failed/Lost/Killed) for both Command and VPS tasks combined.

## Nodes View

This view provides a list of all registered nodes and detailed information for a selected node.

-   **Node List**: A table lists all nodes with their hostname, status (online/offline tag), NUMA node count, total cores, current CPU %, current Memory %, and Last Heartbeat time. It also shows allocated cores and memory based on running/pending tasks.
-   **Node Selection**: Click on any node in the list to load its detailed information in the right-hand panel.
-   **Node Details Panel**:
    -   Static info (Status, URL, Last Heartbeat).
    -   Dynamic Resources: Detailed current CPU, Memory (Total, Allocated, Used, %) metrics. Includes mini-gauge charts for current usage visualization.
    -   NUMA Topology: Lists detected NUMA nodes on the server, showing associated CPU cores and memory.
    -   GPU Info: Lists detected GPUs on the node with basic specs. For detailed GPU metrics, see the dedicated GPU view.

## GPU View

This view is specifically designed for monitoring NVIDIA GPUs reported by Runner nodes.

-   **Node Grouping**: GPUs are grouped by the node they belong to.
-   **GPU List**: A table lists each detected GPU with its ID, Name, Driver Version, PCI Bus ID, and key real-time metrics:
    -   GPU Utilization (%)
    -   Memory Utilization (%)
    -   Total / Used Memory (MiB)
    -   Temperature (Â°C)
    -   Power Usage / Limit (W)
    -   Clock Speeds (Graphics, Memory)
-   **Utilization Progress Bars**: CPU and Memory utilization are shown with color-coded progress bars for easy visual scanning.
-   **Refresh Data**: Use the refresh button to get the latest data snapshot from the Host.

## Tasks View (Command Tasks)

This view focuses on monitoring **Command tasks**.

-   **Task List**: A table lists all Command tasks with Task ID, Command, Arguments preview, Required Cores, Required GPUs, Status, Assigned Node, Target NUMA, and Submission Time.
-   **Status Tags**: Tasks status is indicated by color-coded tags (Green for completed, Yellow for pending/assigning, Red for failed/killed/lost, Blue/Grey for running/paused).
-   **Task Details**: Click on any task row to open a dialog with comprehensive details about the task's configuration, execution status, timestamps, exit code, and error message.
-   **Task Logs**: Within the Task Details dialog, there are sections for Standard Output and Standard Error logs.
    -   For running tasks, these logs update in near real-time.
    -   For completed/failed tasks, they show the final captured output.
    -   Clicking the header of a log section or the refresh button fetches the latest logs.
    -   You can click on the log content itself to open it in a larger modal viewer.
-   **Actions**: Kill, Pause, and Resume actions are available for tasks in appropriate states.

*Example: Command Task List and Details*

## VPS View (VPS Tasks)

This view focuses on monitoring **VPS tasks**.

-   **Active VPS Task List**: Lists VPS tasks that are currently in an active state (pending, assigning, running, paused). This list is typically shorter than the full task list.
-   **Status Tags**: Similar color-coded status tags as the Tasks view.
-   **Resource Summary**: Displays requested cores, memory, and GPUs.
-   **SSH Port**: For VPS tasks with 'running' status, the dynamically assigned SSH port on the assigned Runner is displayed. This is the port you would use to connect via `hakuriver.ssh`.
-   **Actions**: Kill, Pause, and Resume actions are available for tasks in appropriate states.
-   **Task Details**: Clicking on a VPS task row may open a details view (similar to Command tasks, but without stdout/stderr logs).

## Refreshing Data

Most views (Nodes, GPUs, Tasks, VPS) include a refresh button (often with a spinning icon) to manually fetch the latest data from the Host API. Lists and some details also auto-refresh periodically.

## Troubleshooting with the Dashboard

-   If a node is offline, check the Nodes view for its last heartbeat time.
-   If tasks are stuck in 'pending' or 'assigning', check the Nodes view to see if potential target nodes are online and have available resources.
-   If tasks fail, use the Tasks Details view to check the exit code and error message, and view the standard error logs.
-   If a VPS isn't starting, check its status in the VPS view and look for errors.
-   If GPU tasks aren't performing, check the GPU view for utilization and temperature, and compare required GPUs in Task Details with available GPUs in the GPU view.
