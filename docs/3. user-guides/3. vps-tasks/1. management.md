# VPS Task Management Guide

This guide explains how to submit, manage, and list **VPS tasks** in HakuRiver using the `hakuriver.vps` and `hakuriver.client` CLI tools, and the Web Dashboard. VPS tasks launch persistent, interactive Docker containers configured for SSH access.

For guidance on running non-interactive batch jobs, see the [Command Task Submission Guide](../2. command-tasks/1. submission.md).

## What is a VPS Task?

A VPS task in HakuRiver is a running Docker container designed to provide an interactive shell session accessible via SSH. It's like having a lightweight "virtual private server" running on one of your compute nodes, provisioned on demand by HakuRiver.

Key characteristics of VPS tasks:
-   They are typically long-running (`--restart unless-stopped`).
-   They require a Docker container environment with an SSH server installed and configured (see [Container Workflow Guide](../1. container-workflow.md)). The setup procedure will try to install ssh server and setup SSH keys automatically, but it is recommended to check the container's Dockerfile for SSH server installation and configuration.
-   You provide your SSH public key during submission, which HakuRiver injects into the container to allow you to log in (usually as the `root` user by default).
-   They are assigned a dynamically chosen SSH port on the assigned Runner node.

## The `hakuriver.vps submit` Command

Use `hakuriver.vps submit` to launch a new VPS task.

```bash
hakuriver.vps submit [OPTIONS]
```

### Options:

-   `--target HOST[:NUMA_ID][::GPU_ID1[,GPU_ID2,...]]`: Specifies the target node for the VPS. **Only one target allowed.** You can specify just the hostname (`node1`), a NUMA node (`node1:0`), or specific GPUs (`node1::0,1`). If omitted, the Host will **auto-select** a suitable node based on resource requests.
-   `--public-key-string KEY_STRING`: Provide your SSH public key directly as a string.
-   `--public-key-file PATH`: Path to a file containing your SSH public key (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). If neither `--public-key-string` nor `--public-key-file` is specified, HakuRiver attempts to read `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` by default.
-   `--cores N`: Number of CPU cores required for the VPS (Default: 0 for auto-select by Host).
-   `--memory SIZE`: Memory limit for the VPS (e.g., `512M`, `4G`). Uses 1000-based units (K, M, G). Optional.
-   `--container NAME`: HakuRiver container environment name to use. VPS tasks **require** a Docker container environment (cannot use `NULL`). Uses default container name if not specified. The selected container **must** have an SSH server installed and configured.
-   `--privileged`: Run Docker container with `--privileged`. Use with caution. Overrides default.
-   `--mount HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH`: Additional host directories to mount (repeatable). Overrides default.

### Example Submissions:

-   **Auto-select node with default container:**
    ```bash
    # Launch a VPS using default container, 2 cores, 4GB memory on any suitable node
    # Uses default public key file (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)
    hakuriver.vps submit --cores 2 --memory 4G
    ```

-   **Target specific node with custom container and public key string:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.vps submit --target nodeA --container my-dev-env --public-key-string "ssh-rsa AAAA..." --cores 4
    ```

-   **Target specific GPUs on a node with a GPU container:**
    ```bash
    # Launch a VPS on nodeC using GPUs 0 and 1
    hakuriver.vps submit --target nodeC::0,1 --container my-cuda-vps-env --public-key-file ~/.ssh/gpu_key.pub --cores 0
    ```

## Listing Active VPS Tasks

To see a list of VPS tasks that are currently in an active state (pending, assigning, running, paused):

```bash
hakuriver.vps status
```

This command queries the Host for tasks of type 'vps' that are not completed, failed, killed, or lost. The output includes:
-   Task ID
-   Status
-   Assigned Node
-   Required Resources (Cores, Memory, GPUs)
-   Submitted/Started Timestamps
-   **SSH Port** (This is the dynamically assigned port on the Runner node, reported by the Runner once the VPS container is running).

This list is crucial for finding the Task ID needed to connect via SSH.

## Managing VPS Tasks (`hakuriver.client`)

VPS tasks are standard HakuRiver tasks once submitted, so you can use general `hakuriver.client` commands to manage them if you know the Task ID.

### Checking Detailed Status

To check the full details of a specific VPS task by its ID:

```bash
hakuriver.client status <vps_task_id>
```
This provides the same detailed output as for command tasks, including the SSH port, container name, assigned node, status, timestamps, etc.

### Killing a VPS Task

To stop a running or paused VPS task:

```bash
hakuriver.client kill <vps_task_id>
# OR using the vps command (does the same thing internally)
# hakuriver.vps kill <vps_task_id>
```
The Host will signal the Runner to stop the Docker container associated with the VPS task. The container is typically configured with `--rm` or cleaned up by the Runner, removing it after stopping.

### Pausing and Resuming a VPS Task

You can pause and resume the Docker container associated with a VPS task:

```bash
# Pause a running VPS task
hakuriver.client command <vps_task_id> pause
# OR using the vps command (does the same thing internally)
# hakuriver.vps command <vps_task_id> pause

# Resume a paused VPS task
hakuriver.client command <vps_task_id> resume
# OR using the vps command (does the same thing internally)
# hakuriver.vps command <vps_task_id> resume
```
The Host forwards the `pause` or `unpause` command to the assigned Runner, which executes `docker pause <container_name>` or `docker unpause <container_name>`.

## Web Dashboard Management

The HakuRiver Web Dashboard provides a dedicated "VPS Tasks" view (usually under the "Tasks" section or a separate top-level menu item). This view lists active VPS tasks with their status, assigned node, resources, and most importantly, the **SSH port**.

-   You can view the list of active VPS tasks.
-   You can see the SSH port for running tasks directly in the list.
-   You can kill, pause, or resume tasks using buttons in the UI.
-   The dashboard provides a form for submitting new VPS tasks, including pasting the public key and selecting resources/targets.

## Next Steps

Once you have a VPS task running and know its Task ID, the next step is to connect to it via SSH using the built-in SSH proxy utility. See the [SSH Access for VPS Tasks Guide](2. ssh-access.md).
