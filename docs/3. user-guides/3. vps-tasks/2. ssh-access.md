# SSH Access for VPS Tasks

This guide explains how to connect to your running HakuRiver VPS tasks using the `hakuriver.ssh` utility, which leverages the Host's built-in SSH proxy.

## The Need for an SSH Proxy

When you launch a VPS task, HakuRiver starts a Docker container on a specific Runner node and maps a dynamically chosen port on the Runner's host machine to port 22 inside the container.

Directly connecting to this VPS would typically require:
1.  Knowing the IP address or hostname of the specific Runner node the VPS is running on.
2.  Knowing the specific, dynamically assigned port on that Runner.

This is inconvenient, especially if Runner IPs change or ports are random. The HakuRiver SSH proxy solves this by providing a single, stable entry point on the **Host** server.

## How the SSH Proxy Works

The HakuRiver SSH proxy provides a transparent relay mechanism:

1.  You run `hakuriver.ssh <vps_task_id>` on your client machine.
2.  The `hakuriver.ssh` client connects to the **Host server** on the configured SSH proxy port (`host_ssh_proxy_port`).
3.  It sends a request to the Host asking to be connected to the VPS task identified by `<vps_task_id>`.
4.  The Host looks up `<vps_task_id>` in its database, finds which Runner node it's on, and retrieves the dynamically assigned SSH port for that task.
5.  The Host then acts as an intermediary: it establishes a connection to the Runner's IP and the correct dynamic SSH port.
6.  Data is piped bidirectionally between your local SSH client and the SSH daemon running inside the VPS container, via the Host.
7.  Your SSH client then proceeds with the standard SSH handshake and authentication (using your public key injected during VPS submission) directly with the container's SSH daemon.

You only need to know the VPS Task ID and the Host's address and proxy port (configured in `~/.hakuriver/config.toml`).

## Using `hakuriver.ssh`

To connect to a running VPS task, use the `hakuriver.ssh` command followed by the task ID:

```bash
hakuriver.ssh <vps_task_id>
```

Example:
```bash
hakuriver.ssh 7323718749301768192
```

This command will:
1.  Look up the Host address and SSH proxy port from your `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` file.
2.  Start a temporary local listener (typically on `localhost` on a random free port).
3.  Establish a connection to the Host SSH proxy.
4.  Request the tunnel for the specified `vps_task_id`.
5.  If successful, it will then execute your system's standard `ssh` client command, connecting to `localhost` on the temporary local port it opened.
6.  Your local SSH client traffic is automatically forwarded through the Host proxy to the correct Runner and VPS container.

You should then see output from the SSH server inside the container (e.g., banners, MOTD) and be prompted for your SSH key passphrase if your key is protected. Upon successful authentication, you will get a shell inside the container (usually as `root`).

### Prerequisites for `hakuriver.ssh` Client

-   **SSH Client**: Ensure you have a standard SSH client executable (`ssh`) installed and available in your system's PATH.
-   **HakuRiver Installed**: `hakuriver.ssh` must be installed on your client machine.
-   **Configuration**: Your `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` on the client machine must correctly specify the Host's `host_reachable_address` and `host_ssh_proxy_port`.
-   **Public Key**: Ensure the private key corresponding to the public key you used during VPS submission is available to your local SSH client (e.g., in `~/.ssh/` or added via `ssh-add`).

### Options

-   `--config PATH`: Specify a custom configuration file for `hakuriver.ssh`.
-   `--host HOST_ADDRESS`: Override the Host address from the config.
-   `--proxy-port PORT`: Override the Host SSH proxy port from the config.
-   `--local-port PORT`: Specify a specific local port for the `hakuriver.ssh` client proxy to listen on, instead of letting the OS choose (Default: 0 for OS selection).
-   `--user USER`: Specify the username to connect as inside the container (Default: `root`). HakuRiver injects the key for `root` by default; you'd need to configure the container otherwise for other users.

## Disconnecting

Simply type `exit` in the container shell or close your SSH client session. This will terminate the SSH connection, the local proxy started by `hakuriver.ssh`, and the connection between the Host proxy and the Runner. The VPS container on the Runner will continue running (unless it's stopped due to being paused for too long or crashes).

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

-   **"Task ID not found" or "Task is not a VPS":** Ensure you are using the correct Task ID from the `hakuriver.vps status` list and that the task type is indeed 'vps'.
-   **"VPS task is not active":** The VPS must be in 'running' or 'paused' status. Check `hakuriver.vps status` or `hakuriver.client status <task_id>`.
-   **"Assigned node for VPS task is not online":** The Runner node where the VPS is running must be online. Check `hakuriver.client nodes`.
-   **"Timeout waiting for request" / "Connection refused by server":** The Host server might be down, or the Host SSH proxy port (`host_ssh_proxy_port`) is incorrect or blocked by a firewall between your client and the Host.
-   **"Timeout connecting to Runner":** The Runner node might be offline, or the specific VPS container or its SSH daemon has crashed, or a firewall is blocking the connection from the Host to the Runner on the dynamically assigned port.
-   **SSH client reports connection refused/permission denied/key issues:** The SSH connection reached the container, but the authentication failed.
    -   Verify the public key you used to submit the VPS task is the correct one.
    -   Verify the corresponding private key is available to your SSH client (`ssh-add -l`).
    -   Ensure `PermitRootLogin yes` (or equivalent for your chosen user) is enabled in the container's `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
    -   Check the SSH daemon logs *inside* the container (if you configured logging) for authentication errors.
-   **"Proxy Error: Invalid task ID format."**: The Host SSH proxy expects digits for the task ID.

If issues persist, check the logs of the Host server (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service`) and the Runner server running the VPS (`journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`) for errors related to the task ID or SSH proxy.

## Security Considerations

-   The Host SSH proxy is a critical security component. **Restrict access to the `host_ssh_proxy_port`** to only trusted client IP addresses or networks using firewalls.
-   Ensure the public key used for VPS submission is securely managed.
-   The default setup injects the key for the `root` user. Harden the container environment and be cautious about granting root access.
