# SSH Access for VPS Tasks

This guide explains how to connect to VPS tasks using the built-in SSH proxy.

---

## How It Works

### The SSH Proxy

KohakuRiver provides a transparent SSH proxy through the Host server:

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌───────────┐
│  Client  │───▶│   Host   │───▶│  Runner  │───▶│    VPS    │
│  (you)   │    │  Proxy   │    │ (node)   │    │ Container │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └───────────┘
    :8002          :8002           :random         :22
```

Benefits:
- Single entry point (Host)
- No need to know Runner IPs
- No need to track dynamic ports

## Quick Connect

### Using vps connect

```bash
kohakuriver vps connect <task_id>
```

This handles everything automatically:
1. Looks up VPS connection info
2. Establishes proxy tunnel
3. Runs SSH with correct parameters

### Example

```bash
# List your VPS to get Task ID
kohakuriver vps list

# Connect
kohakuriver vps connect 7323718749301768192
```

---

## Connection Options

### Custom SSH Key

```bash
kohakuriver vps connect <task_id> --key ~/.ssh/my_vps_key
```

### Common SSH Flags

The connect command passes through to the system SSH client, supporting standard options:

```bash
# Port forwarding
kohakuriver vps connect <task_id> -- -L 8888:localhost:8888

# X11 forwarding
kohakuriver vps connect <task_id> -- -X
```

---

## Manual Connection

If you know the Runner node and port:

```bash
# Get VPS details
kohakuriver vps status <task_id>
# Note the "Node" and "SSH Port"

# Connect directly
ssh -p <port> root@<runner_hostname>
```

---

## Using SSH Config

Add entries to `~/.ssh/config` for frequently used VPS:

```ssh-config
Host myvps
    HostName <runner_hostname>
    Port <ssh_port>
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_vps_key
```

Then connect with:

```bash
ssh myvps
```

**Note:** This requires knowing the specific port, which is dynamic.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| VPS not running | Check `kohakuriver vps status <id>` |
| Wrong Task ID | Verify with `kohakuriver vps list` |
| Firewall blocking | Check port 8002 is accessible on Host |

### Authentication Failed

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Wrong key | Verify key matches what was used at creation |
| Key permissions | Run `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/your_key` |
| Root login disabled | Check container's sshd_config |

### Timeout Issues

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Host unreachable | Check network to Host server |
| Runner offline | Verify with `kohakuriver node list` |
| Container crashed | Try `kohakuriver vps restart <id>` |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check VPS status
kohakuriver vps status <task_id>

# Check Runner is online
kohakuriver node list

# View Host logs (on Host server)
journalctl -u kohakuriver-host -f

# View Runner logs (on Runner node)
journalctl -u kohakuriver-runner -f
```

## Security Considerations

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Use SSH keys only** | Never enable password auth |
| **Restrict proxy access** | Firewall port 8002 to trusted networks |
| **Generate unique keys** | Use `--gen-ssh-key` for each VPS |
| **Monitor sessions** | Check active VPS regularly |

See [Security Guide](../../2.%20admin-guides/5.%20security.md) for comprehensive security recommendations.

## Disconnecting

Simply type `exit` or close the SSH session. The VPS container continues running until explicitly stopped.
