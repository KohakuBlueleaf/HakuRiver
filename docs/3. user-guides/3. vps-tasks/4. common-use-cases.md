# Common Use Cases for VPS Tasks

HakuRiver VPS tasks are designed to provide flexible, on-demand interactive computing environments on your cluster nodes. Here are some typical scenarios where VPS tasks are useful:

## 1. Interactive Development and Experimentation

-   **Scenario**: You need to develop or debug a script or code that requires specific libraries or tools not installed on your local machine, or requires access to resources (like GPUs or large datasets on shared storage) available only on your cluster nodes.
-   **How VPS Helps**: Launch a VPS task on a suitable node with a pre-configured Docker environment containing your development tools and libraries. You can then SSH into this environment and use it as if it were a remote development machine, with direct access to shared storage (`/shared`) and potentially `/local_temp` for fast I/O.

## 2. Ad-Hoc Analysis or Prototyping

-   **Scenario**: You have a new dataset or an idea for an analysis that you want to explore interactively on a cluster node without setting up a formal batch job or configuring your local machine.
-   **How VPS Helps**: Spin up a VPS task on a node with the necessary resources (CPU, RAM, GPU). SSH in, access the data on shared storage, and run interactive tools like Jupyter notebooks (if installed in the container and accessed via port forwarding) or command-line analysis tools.

## 3. Debugging Failed Batch Tasks

-   **Scenario**: A Command task failed when running on a specific node, and you suspect an environment issue or a problem with the script's execution context on that node.
-   **How VPS Helps**: Launch a VPS task on the *same node* where the batch task failed, using the *same container environment* if possible. SSH into the VPS and manually try to execute the command or parts of the script that failed. This allows you to inspect the filesystem, environment variables, and reproduce the error interactively.

## 4. Accessing Node-Specific Resources

-   **Scenario**: You need interactive access to a specific node for debugging, system-level checks (if the container has privileges), or interacting with hardware only available on that node (e.g., specific peripherals, NUMA architecture details that are easier to inspect interactively).
-   **How VPS Helps**: Launch a VPS task targeted to that specific node. While HakuRiver Command tasks can use the Systemd fallback (`--container NULL`) for direct host access, a VPS task in a potentially privileged container offers a more persistent interactive entry point for deeper inspection if needed.

## 5. On-Demand Temporary Workstations

-   **Scenario**: You have team members who occasionally need access to a powerful environment for specific tasks but don't require dedicated machines.
-   **How VPS Helps**: Provide users with access to submit VPS tasks. They can launch a VPS when needed, perform their work via SSH, and ideally kill the task when finished, freeing up resources.

## Considerations for VPS Use

-   **Environment Preparation**: Ensure the container image used for VPS tasks has `openssh-server` installed and configured correctly, and that the user you intend to log in as (usually `root`) is set up for public key authentication.
-   **Resource Usage**: VPS tasks are persistent (by default, they will restart unless stopped). Be mindful of resource allocation (`--cores`, `--memory`, GPUs) and encourage users to kill VPS tasks when they are no longer needed to free up resources for batch jobs.
-   **Security**: VPS tasks grant interactive shell access. Ensure you are comfortable with the security implications, especially if granting root access. Use strong SSH keys and restrict network access to the Host SSH proxy port.

By understanding these use cases and considerations, you can effectively utilize HakuRiver's VPS tasks to provide flexible interactive computing alongside your batch workloads.
