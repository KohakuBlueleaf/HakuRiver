# Preparing Your Container Image for VPS Tasks

VPS tasks in HakuRiver run standard Docker containers, but they require specific setup *inside the container image* to function as interactive SSH environments. This guide details the necessary steps using the [Container Workflow Guide](../1. container-workflow.md).

## Essential Requirements for a VPS Container

For a Docker image to be usable as a HakuRiver VPS, it *must* have:

1.  An **SSH server** installed.
2.  The SSH server configured to allow **public key authentication**.
3.  The SSH server configured to allow the user HakuRiver injects the key for (typically `root`) to **log in**.
4.  A mechanism to **start the SSH daemon** when the container runs.

## Step-by-Step Preparation

Use the standard HakuRiver container workflow to prepare your VPS image.

**Phase 1: Create and Customize on the Host**

1.  **Choose a Base Image**: Start with a suitable base image. Minimal images like `ubuntu:22.04`, `debian:11-slim`, or `alpine:latest` are good choices, but ensure they are compatible with `openssh-server` or an alternative SSH daemon. If you need specific software or drivers (like CUDA), start with a base image that already includes them or is compatible with their installation (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA images).
    ```bash
    # On your Client machine
    hakuriver.docker create-container ubuntu:22.04 my-ubuntu-vps-base
    # Or if you need GPUs
    # hakuriver.docker create-container nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04 my-cuda-vps-base
    ```

2.  **Install SSH Server and Tools**: Get an interactive shell into the newly created container on the Host and install the necessary packages. `openssh-server` is the most common SSH daemon. You might also want standard tools like `nano` or `vim` for interactive sessions.
    ```bash
    hakuriver.docker-shell my-ubuntu-vps-base

    # Inside the container shell (commands vary by distribution):
    # For Debian/Ubuntu:
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y openssh-server nano

    # For Alpine:
    # apk update
    # apk add --no-cache openssh nano

    # For CentOS/RHEL:
    # yum update -y
    # yum install -y openssh-server nano

    # You might need to create the directory /run/sshd on some Debian/Ubuntu versions
    # mkdir -p /run/sshd

    # Exit the shell
    exit
    ```

3.  **Configure SSH Daemon (`sshd_config`)**: The default HakuRiver VPS setup injects the user's public key into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and attempts to run `sshd` as root. This requires SSH public key authentication and root login to be enabled in the SSH server configuration.
    - Get back into the shell: `hakuriver.docker-shell my-ubuntu-vps-base`
    - Edit the SSH daemon configuration file, typically `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
      ```bash
      # Inside the container shell:
      # nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      ```
    - Ensure the following settings are present and uncommented:
      ```
      PubkeyAuthentication yes
      AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys
      PermitRootLogin yes # REQUIRED for HakuRiver's default key injection
      PasswordAuthentication no # Highly recommended for security (disable passwords)
      ```
    - Save the file and exit the shell.

4.  **Generate Host Keys (Optional but Recommended)**: While `sshd` will usually generate host keys on first run if they are missing, it's good practice to generate them *in the image* to avoid a delay on first container start.
    - Get back into the shell: `hakuriver.docker-shell my-ubuntu-vps-base`
    - Run the key generation command:
      ```bash
      # Inside the container shell:
      # ssh-keygen -A
      ```
    - Exit the shell.

5.  **Clean Up**: Clean up package manager caches and unnecessary files to reduce image size.
    - Get back into the shell: `hakuriver.docker-shell my-ubuntu-vps-base`
    - Run cleanup commands:
      ```bash
      # Inside the container shell:
      # For Debian/Ubuntu:
      # apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

      # For Alpine:
      # rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

      # For CentOS/RHEL:
      # yum clean all && rm -rf /var/cache/yum

      # Exit the shell
      exit
      ```

**Phase 2: Package and Distribute**

6.  **Create the Tarball**: Now that the persistent Host container is configured, package its state into a distributable tarball.
    ```bash
    # On your Client machine
    hakuriver.docker create-tar my-ubuntu-vps-base
    ```
    This commits the changes, saves the image `hakuriver/my-ubuntu-vps-base:base` to a tarball in shared storage, and cleans up older versions.

7.  **Verify Tarball**: Confirm the tarball exists in shared storage.
    ```bash
    hakuriver.docker list-tars
    ```

## Using the Prepared Container for VPS Tasks

When you submit a VPS task using `hakuriver.vps submit --container my-ubuntu-vps-base ...`, the Runner will:

1.  Sync the `my-ubuntu-vps-base` image tarball if needed.
2.  Launch a new container from this image (`docker run -d --restart unless-stopped ...`).
3.  Inject the public key provided during submission into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` inside the container.
4.  Start the SSH daemon (`sshd`) in the foreground, replacing the container's default entrypoint/command.
5.  Map a dynamic port on the Runner host to port 22 in the container.
6.  Report the dynamic host port back to the Host.

You should then be able to connect using `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>` and authenticate with your private key.

## Considerations

-   **User other than Root**: If you want to log in as a user other than `root`, you need to:
    -   Create that user in the container image during preparation (`adduser myuser`).
    -   Ensure the SSH daemon is configured to allow login for `myuser`.
    -   HakuRiver's default key injection is for `root`. You would need to manually inject the key into `/home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys` as part of a custom entrypoint script that HakuRiver executes, or adapt the HakuRiver Runner code. The simplest approach is to stick with root access via key injection for now.
-   **Container Entrypoint/CMD**: HakuRiver's VPS runner replaces the container's default `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` with its own command to set up the key and start `sshd`. Ensure your base image doesn't have conflicting or interfering startup scripts that prevent `sshd` from running or bind to port 22 prematurely.
-   **Driver/Library Compatibility (for GPU VPS)**: If preparing a GPU-enabled VPS image, ensure the CUDA/cuDNN libraries installed inside the container are compatible with the NVIDIA driver version on your Runner nodes.

By following these steps, you can create reproducible and functional container images for your HakuRiver VPS tasks.
