# Monitoring Tasks, Nodes, and Resources

Effective monitoring is essential for managing your HakuRiver cluster. This guide explains how to monitor the status and resource usage of nodes, track the lifecycle and output of tasks (both Command and VPS), and troubleshoot issues using both command-line tools and the Web Dashboard.

## Command-Line Monitoring

HakuRiver provides several CLI tools to monitor your cluster's state.

### Node Monitoring (`hakuriver.client`)

-   **List Nodes:** See all registered Runner nodes and their basic status, core counts, NUMA nodes, and last heartbeat time.
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client nodes
    ```
    Output includes `hostname`, `status` (online/offline), `total_cores`, `available_cores`, `numa_topology` summary, `gpu_info` summary, and `last_heartbeat`.
-   **Detailed Node Health:** Get real-time CPU, memory, **temperature**, and **GPU** statistics for a specific node or all nodes.
    ```bash
    # Check health for all nodes
    hakuriver.client health

    # Check health for a specific node
    hakuriver.client health nodeA
    ```
    Output includes `cpu_percent`, `memory_percent`, `memory_used_bytes`, `memory_total_bytes`, `current_avg_temp`, `current_max_temp`, and detailed `gpu_info` (ID, name, utilization, temperature, memory, etc.). It also includes historical data points for recent trends.

### Task Monitoring (`hakuriver.client`, `hakuriver.task`, `hakuriver.vps`)

-   **Check Task Status:** Get the detailed status of any task (Command or VPS) by its ID.
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client status <task_id>
    ```
    This shows `task_id`, `status`, `assigned_node`, `required_cores`, `required_memory_bytes`, `required_gpus`, `submitted_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `exit_code`, `error_message`, `container_name` used, `target_numa_node_id`, and (for VPS tasks) `ssh_port`.
-   **List Active VPS Tasks:** Get a list of all VPS tasks currently in an active state (pending, assigning, running, paused).
    ```bash
    hakuriver.vps status
    ```
    This provides a concise list focused on the key details for active VPS sessions, including `task_id`, `status`, `assigned_node`, required resources, timestamps, and `ssh_port`.
-   **View Command Task Output:** Retrieve standard output or standard error logs for Command tasks.
    ```bash
    # View standard output for a Command task
    hakuriver.task stdout <command_task_id>

    # View standard error for a Command task
    hakuriver.task stderr <command_task_id>
    ```
    *Note: This is only for Command tasks. VPS tasks do not write to these files; their interaction is via SSH.*

## Web Dashboard Monitoring

The HakuRiver Web Dashboard provides a visual and user-friendly interface for monitoring cluster state.

-   **Dashboard Home**: Offers an aggregate view of cluster resource usage (CPU, Memory, with historical graphs) and task counts by status (Command and VPS combined).
-   **Nodes View**: Lists all registered nodes with status indicators and resource summaries. Clicking a node shows detailed stats, NUMA topology, and allocated resources based on tasks.
-   **GPU View**: Provides a detailed table listing all reported GPUs across all online nodes. Shows real-time utilization (GPU & Memory), temperature, power, and other specs for each GPU. This is the best place for a quick overview of GPU health and load.
-   **Tasks View**: Lists and allows management of **Command tasks**. Includes detailed task information, filtering, and a built-in log viewer for `stdout` and `stderr`.
-   **VPS View**: Lists and allows management of **VPS tasks**. Provides task status, assigned node, resources, and the critical **SSH Port** for running tasks.

## Logs and Debugging

### System Logs

HakuRiver Host and Runner components write logs that are invaluable for debugging setup issues or service failures.

-   **Host Logs:** If running the Host via systemd, use `sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service`. Otherwise, check the file specified in `[paths] host_log_file` in your config, or the console output if no log file is configured.
-   **Runner Logs:** If running the Runner via systemd, use `sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`. Otherwise, check the file specified in `[paths] runner_log_file` (which includes the hostname) or console output.

Check these logs for errors related to:
-   Service startup or shutdown.
-   Host-Runner communication failures.
-   Database errors (on Host).
-   Docker command execution failures (on Host for management, on Runner for tasks).
-   Systemd-run execution errors (on Runner).
-   SSH proxy connection errors (on Host).

### Task Logs (Command Tasks)

Standard output and standard error for Command tasks are written to files in `shared_dir/task_outputs/` and `shared_dir/task_errors/`. The filenames are the Task ID followed by `.out` or `.err`.

-   Access directly on shared storage: `cat <shared_dir>/task_outputs/<task_id>.out`
-   Access via CLI: `hakuriver.task stdout <task_id>`, `hakuriver.task stderr <task_id>`
-   Access via Web Dashboard: In the Task Details modal.

### VPS Task Information

VPS tasks don't write to the shared log files. Their interactive nature means output goes directly to the connected SSH client. For debugging issues *within* the container or with the SSH daemon:

-   Check SSH daemon logs inside the container (if configured).
-   Check Runner systemd logs (`journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`) for errors related to the Docker container startup (`hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`).
-   Check the Host SSH proxy logs (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service` if proxy runs within the Host service) for connection errors from the client.

## Resource Monitoring

Monitor resource usage to understand cluster load, identify bottlenecks, and plan for capacity.

-   **CPU/Memory:** Use `hakuriver.client health` or the Dashboard Home/Nodes views for real-time and historical usage.
-   **GPU:** Use `hakuriver.client health` or the Dashboard GPU View for real-time utilization, temperature, and memory usage per GPU.
-   **Disk Space:** Regularly monitor disk space on shared storage (`shared_dir`) and Docker data roots (`/var/lib/docker` or equivalent) using standard system tools (`df -h`). Running out of disk space is a common cause of task failures.
-   **Network:** Monitor network traffic between Host, Runners, and shared storage, especially if experiencing slow container syncs or log access.

## Alert Setup (External)

HakuRiver does not include a built-in alerting system. For production use, integrate with external monitoring and alerting systems:

-   **Scripted Checks:** Write simple scripts that use `hakuriver.client` to check node status, task counts, or resource usage thresholds. Run these scripts via `cron` and send email/notifications if conditions are met.
-   **Integration with Monitoring Systems:** Collect metrics by parsing `hakuriver.client health` output or potentially building a custom exporter that interacts with the Host API. Feed these metrics into systems like Prometheus+Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix, etc., to configure dashboards and alerts.

## Monitoring Best Practices

-   **Regular Status Checks**: Automate basic health checks of Host and Runners.
-   **Set Thresholds**: Define acceptable ranges for resource utilization and task queue lengths, and set up alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
-   **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review logs from HakuRiver components, Docker, and Systemd.
-   **Correlate Events**: When a task fails, check logs on the assigned Runner, the Host, and potentially the shared storage to understand the cause.
-   **Use the Right Tool**: The Dashboard is great for visual overview and real-time status. CLI tools are better for scripting, detailed output, and single checks. `journalctl` is essential for service-level debugging.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues (Review)

-   **Node Offline**: Check network, Runner process, Runner logs, config (`runner_address`, `host_reachable_address`, ports).
-   **Task Failed**: Check task status (`hakuriver.client status`), logs (`hakuriver.task stdout/stderr` or Dashboard log viewer), error message, and Runner logs. Check if the required container exists/synced, disk space, and resource availability on the assigned node.
-   **VPS SSH Connection Issues**: Check VPS status (`hakuriver.vps status`), `ssh_port`, network connectivity, Host SSH proxy logs, Runner logs, and SSH daemon config/logs inside the container. Verify public/private key pair.
-   **Resource Exhaustion**: Use `hakuriver.client health` or Dashboard to identify overloaded nodes or resource-intensive tasks. Consider killing or rescheduling tasks.
-   **Docker/Systemd Execution Issues**: Check Runner logs for errors launching containers or systemd units. Verify Docker daemon status, `sudo` permissions for the runner user, and `numactl` path/permissions if used.

By actively monitoring your HakuRiver cluster, you can ensure smooth operation, quickly diagnose problems, and make informed decisions about resource usage and capacity planning.
