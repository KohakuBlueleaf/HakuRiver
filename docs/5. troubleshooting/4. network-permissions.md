# Troubleshooting Network and Permission Issues

Network connectivity and file/system permissions are fundamental prerequisites for HakuRiver. Issues in these areas can prevent components from communicating, Runners from executing tasks, or clients from accessing logs/VPS sessions.

This guide covers common network and permission problems and how to diagnose them. Before starting, ensure you have reviewed the [Common Issues Guide](1. common-issues.md).

## Network Connectivity Issues

HakuRiver components communicate over the network via HTTP/S and a custom TCP protocol for the SSH proxy.

**Key Communication Paths:**

1.  **Runner -> Host API:** Registration (`/api/register`), Heartbeats (`/api/heartbeat`), Task Status Updates (`/api/update`), Runner-detected Kill/Command Responses (`/run`, etc.). (Ports: `host_port`)
2.  **Host API -> Runner API:** Task Dispatch (`/run`), Kill Request (`/kill`), Pause/Resume Request (`/pause`, `/resume`). (Ports: `runner_port`)
3.  **Client CLI/Web UI -> Host API:** Node Info (`/api/nodes`), Health (`/api/health`), Task Status (`/api/status`), Task/VPS Submission (`/api/submit`), Docker Management (`/api/docker/*`), Log Retrieval (`/api/task/.../stdout/stderr`). (Ports: `host_port`)
4.  **Client SSH -> Host SSH Proxy:** Initial request to tunnel to a VPS task. (Ports: `host_ssh_proxy_port`)
5.  **Host SSH Proxy -> Runner -> VPS Container:** The SSH tunnel itself, from the Host to the specific Runner node and the dynamically assigned port on that Runner that maps to port 22 in the VPS container. (Ports: dynamic, on Runner)
6.  **Host/Runner -> Shared Storage:** Filesystem access over the network (e.g., NFS, SMB, GlusterFS). (Ports: Varies by FS protocol)

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Verify Configuration:** Ensure the IP addresses/hostnames (`host_reachable_address`, `runner_address`, `host_bind_ip`) and port numbers (`host_port`, `runner_port`, `host_ssh_proxy_port`) in `config.toml` are correct on *all* relevant machines. Hostnames must resolve correctly (DNS or `/etc/hosts`).
2.  **Check Service Status:** Ensure Host (`hakuriver-host.service`) and Runner (`hakuriver-runner.service`) services are running without errors.
3.  **Use `ping`:** Test basic network reachability between machines.
    *   From Runner to Host: `ping <host_reachable_address>`
    *   From Host to Runner: `ping <runner_address>`
    *   From Client to Host: `ping <host_reachable_address>`
4.  **Use `telnet` or `nc` (netcat):** Test if specific ports are open and listening.
    *   From Runner to Host API: `telnet <host_reachable_address> <host_port>`
    *   From Host to Runner API: `telnet <runner_address> <runner_port>`
    *   From Client to Host API: `telnet <host_reachable_address> <host_port>`
    *   From Client to Host SSH Proxy: `telnet <host_reachable_address> <host_ssh_proxy_port>`
    *   From Host SSH Proxy (wherever it runs) to Runner/VPS: This one is harder to test directly because the port is dynamic. You'd need to get the SSH port from `hakuriver.vps status` and then test `telnet <runner_address> <ssh_port>` from the Host machine *after* the VPS is running.
5.  **Check Firewalls:** Firewalls (`ufw`, `firewalld`, iptables) are the most common cause of blocked ports.
    *   On Host: Ensure incoming traffic is allowed on `host_port` (from Runners/Clients) and `host_ssh_proxy_port` (from Clients).
    *   On Runner: Ensure incoming traffic is allowed on `runner_port` (from Host) and the dynamically assigned SSH ports for VPS containers (from Host SSH Proxy).
    *   On Client: Ensure outgoing traffic is allowed to Host's `host_port` and `host_ssh_proxy_port`.
6.  **Check Network File System (NFS, SMB, etc.):** If `shared_dir` is on network storage, verify the storage server is online and accessible from Host/Runners via the specific filesystem protocol's ports. Check mount status (`df -h <shared_dir>`) and logs related to the client-side NFS/SMB service.
7.  **Check Logs:** Look for network-related errors in the Host and Runner systemd logs (`httpx.RequestError`, `ConnectionRefusedError`, `TimeoutError`, `OSError`).

## File and Directory Permissions Issues

HakuRiver components need read/write access to specific files and directories:

1.  **Configuration Files:** `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` (read by all CLIs, Host, Runner), custom config files (read by components launched with `--config`).
2.  **Database File:** `[database] db_file` (read/write by Host).
3.  **Shared Directory:** `[paths] shared_dir` (read/write by Host and Runner, including subdirectories `container_dir`, `task_outputs`, `task_errors`, `shared_data`). Read by Host for logs, read by Runner for tarballs, write by Runner for logs, read/write by task processes/containers for data.
4.  **Local Temp Directory:** `[paths] local_temp_dir` (read/write by Runner and task processes/containers).
5.  **Log Files:** `[paths] host_log_file`, `[paths] runner_log_file` (write by Host/Runner).
6.  **Docker Socket:** `/var/run/docker.sock` (read/write by Host and Runner services if running Docker tasks).
7.  **System Binaries/Libraries:** `numactl`, `systemd-run`, `systemctl`, `docker` executables and their linked libraries (read by Runner/tasks).

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Identify Affected User:** Determine which user is running the process that is failing (e.g., the user running `hakuriver.host`/`hakuriver.runner`, or the user specified by `[environment] runner_user`, or the user inside a Docker container, typically `root`). Check the systemd service file for `User=` and `Group=`.
2.  **Check Permissions:** Use `ls -la <path>` to check ownership and permissions of the file or directory.
    *   Does the user own the file/directory or belong to a group with appropriate permissions?
    *   Does the user or group have read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions as needed? (Execute is needed for directories to traverse them, and for files to run them).
    *   Check permissions on parent directories as well.
3.  **Check Shared Storage Mount Options:** If permissions seem correct but fail on shared storage, check mount options (`/etc/fstab`, `mount -l`). Options like `no_root_squash` (NFS), `uid`, `gid`, `file_mode`, `dir_mode` (CIFS) can affect how users/groups are mapped and permissions are enforced.
4.  **Check Docker User/Group:** Ensure the user running the Docker tasks *inside* the container has appropriate permissions for mounted volumes (`/shared`, `/local_temp`, etc.). Default container users are often `root`, but may differ. Permissions mapping between host UIDs/GIDs and container UIDs/GIDs can be complex.
5.  **Check Logs:** Look for `PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `OSError`, or specific errors like "Permission denied" from commands executed by Runner or tasks.

## System/Sudo Permissions Issues (Runner)

The Runner service user often needs passwordless `sudo` to execute commands as another user (`[environment] runner_user`), or to execute `systemd-run`, `systemctl`, `numactl`, or potentially `docker` commands depending on setup.

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Check Error Message:** Errors like `sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified`, `(runner_username : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`, or command-specific permission denied messages after `sudo` in Runner logs.
2.  **Check `visudo` Configuration:** As root, use `visudo` to inspect the `/etc/sudoers` file and files in `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
    *   Does the Runner user have an entry?
    *   Does the entry include `NOPASSWD:`?
    *   Does the entry list the specific commands (`/usr/bin/systemd-run`, `/usr/bin/systemctl`, `/usr/bin/numactl`, `/usr/bin/docker`) the Runner needs to execute without a password?
3.  **Verify Command Paths:** Ensure the paths to the commands in the `sudoers` file match the actual paths on the system (`which <command>`).

**Solution:** Edit `/etc/sudoers` using `visudo` to add or correct the `NOPASSWD` entries for the Runner user, listing the required commands with their full paths.
