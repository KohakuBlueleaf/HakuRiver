# Troubleshooting VPS and SSH Connectivity Issues

This guide focuses on diagnosing and resolving problems specifically related to HakuRiver VPS tasks and connecting to them via SSH using the `hakuriver.ssh` proxy.

Before using this guide, ensure you have checked the [Common Issues Guide](1. common-issues.md) for basic setup and connectivity problems.

## Task Status: VPS Task Stuck in 'Pending' or 'Assigning'

**Symptom:** You submit a VPS task (`hakuriver.vps submit`), and its status remains 'pending' or 'assigning' for longer than expected (e.g., >30 seconds), without changing to 'running' or 'failed'.

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Check Task Status Details:** Use `hakuriver.client status <task_id>` or the Web Dashboard VPS view. Note the status and assigned node (if 'assigning').
2.  **Check Host Logs:** On the Host machine, check the logs (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service`). Look for messages related to:
    *   Receiving the `/api/submit` request for your task ID.
    *   Validation errors for the request (e.g., invalid public key, invalid target).
    *   Finding a suitable node (if auto-selecting).
    *   Database errors when creating the task record.
    *   Attempting to dispatch the task to the assigned Runner (`Attempting to send task <task_id> to runner at <runner_url>`).
    *   Errors reported when trying to connect to the Runner's `/run` endpoint.
3.  **Check Assigned Runner Status and Logs:** If the task status is 'assigning' and an `assigned_node` is listed, log into that Runner node.
    *   Check Runner service status: `sudo systemctl status hakuriver-runner.service`. Is the Runner running?
    *   Check Runner logs: `sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`. Look for messages about receiving the task (`Accepted task <task_id>`) or errors encountered immediately upon receiving it (e.g., "Task <task_id> is already tracked", "Configuration error: LOCAL_TEMP_DIR missing", "Docker image sync check/load failed").

**Common Scenarios and Solutions:**

*   **Invalid Public Key Format:**
    *   **Logs (Host):** Host logs will show validation errors upon receiving the `/api/submit` request.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure your public key string starts with `ssh-` and is correctly formatted. Re-submit with the correct key.
*   **Invalid/Unavailable Target:**
    *   **Logs (Host):** Host logs will show warnings/errors if the specified `--target` node is not registered, offline, or doesn't have requested resources (cores/memory/GPUs) available. The submission response will list failed targets.
    *   **Solution:** Check `hakuriver.client nodes` and `hakuriver.client health` to verify node status and resource availability. Re-submit targeting an available node/resources.
*   **Host Cannot Reach Runner `/run` Endpoint:**
    *   **Logs (Host):** Host logs show `httpx.RequestError` when trying to `POST` to the Runner's `/run` endpoint.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the Runner is running and its `runner_port` is open and accessible from the Host's IP. Check firewalls on the Runner. Verify the Runner's `runner_address` is correctly set in its config and matches an address the Host can reach.
*   **Docker Image Sync Failed (on Runner):**
    *   **Logs (Runner):** Runner logs show errors related to `Docker image sync check/load failed`.
    *   **Solution:** See [Troubleshooting Task Execution Failures - Docker image load failed](#task-execution-failures). Ensure the container tarball exists and is readable on the Runner's `shared_dir`, and `docker load` works.
*   **Runner Rejected Task (Status 409 Conflict):**
    *   **Logs (Runner):** Runner logs show "Received request to run task <task_id>, but it is already tracked".
    *   **Cause:** The Host sent the task, but the Runner already thought it was running or assigned (potentially from a previous attempt or a stale state).
    *   **Solution:** This shouldn't happen often with Snowflake IDs. If it does, check Runner state and logs. The task might eventually fail on the Host side due to suspicion timeout.

## Task Status: VPS Task is 'Failed'

**Symptom:** A VPS task status changes to 'failed' shortly after starting, or after some time.

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Check Task Status Details:** Use `hakuriver.client status <task_id>`. Note the `error_message` and `exit_code`.
2.  **Check Runner Logs:** Log into the `assigned_node` and check `sudo journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`. Look for errors related to launching the Docker container for `hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`.
3.  **Check Docker Logs:** On the Runner, check the Docker daemon logs: `sudo journalctl -u docker.service`. Look for errors related to container creation or startup for `hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`.
4.  **Check Container Logs:** On the Runner, for persistent containers like VPS, check the container's own logs: `docker logs hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`. This is output from the container's entrypoint/command (which HakuRiver sets to inject the key and start `sshd`). Look for errors related to SSH key injection or `sshd` startup.

**Common Scenarios and Solutions:**

*   **"Docker image load failed" / Image Not Found (on Runner):**
    *   **Logs (Runner):** Runner logs show errors loading the tarball.
    *   **Cause:** Same as for Command tasks (see [Troubleshooting Task Execution Failures](#task-execution-failures)).
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the container tarball exists and is readable on the Runner, and `docker load` works.
*   **"Failed to launch task via systemd-run" / systemd errors:**
    *   **Cause:** This error message usually indicates HakuRiver *tried* to use systemd. Systemd fallback (`--container NULL`) is NOT supported for VPS tasks.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure you specified a Docker container name (or left it blank for Host default) when submitting the VPS task. The container name cannot be "NULL".
*   **"Failed to start container" / Docker API Errors:**
    *   **Logs (Runner):** Runner logs show errors from `docker run` command. Error message might indicate issues like invalid `--gpus` argument, conflicting container name (shouldn't happen with task ID), etc.
    *   **Solution:** Check the exact `docker run` command the Runner attempted (from Runner logs). Debug the Docker command manually on the Runner. Verify requested resources (GPUs) are valid.
*   **"No suitable shell found" / Entrypoint errors:**
    *   **Logs (Runner, Container):** Container logs (`docker logs hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`) show errors related to `/bin/sh -c <setup_script>`. Error message might mention commands not found (like `ssh-keygen`, `sshd`, `apt-get`), or issues with the setup script itself.
    *   **Cause:** The container image is missing essential binaries or libraries needed by the SSH setup script run by HakuRiver (e.g., `sshd`, `ssh-keygen`, `apt-get`/`yum`/`apk`). Or the setup script failed.
    *   **Solution:** Debug the container image setup. Get a shell into the image (`docker run --rm -it <image> /bin/bash`) and manually run the commands HakuRiver uses (install openssh-server, ssh-keygen -A, start sshd) to see where it fails. Ensure `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` exists. Use a base image with these tools or install them during image preparation.
*   **"Failed to inject SSH key" / Permission Issues:**
    *   **Logs (Runner, Container):** Container logs or Runner logs might show errors related to writing the `authorized_keys` file.
    *   **Cause:** The script trying to write `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` lacks permissions, or the `/root/.ssh` directory doesn't exist or has wrong permissions.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the container image allows writing to `/root/.ssh/` or `/home/user/.ssh` if using a non-root user. The setup script HakuRiver uses typically handles directory creation/permissions, but base image specifics can interfere.
*   **"Failed to find SSH port":**
    *   **Logs (Runner):** Runner logs show "Failed to find SSH port for container..." after the container starts.
    *   **Cause:** The `docker port <container_name> 22` command failed on the Runner. This usually means the container didn't actually start or crashed immediately, or Docker didn't correctly map port 22.
    *   **Solution:** Check `docker ps -a` on the Runner; is the container `hakuriver-vps-<task_id>` listed and in a 'running' state? Check `docker logs hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`.

## SSH Connection Failures (`hakuriver.ssh <task_id>`)

**Symptom:** `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>` gives errors like "Connection refused", "Timeout", "Host key verification failed", "Permission denied (publickey)".

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1.  **Verify VPS Status:** Use `hakuriver.vps status`. Ensure the task ID is correct and the status is 'running'. Note the `ssh_port`.
2.  **Check Client Config:** On your client machine, verify `[network] host_reachable_address` and `[network] host_ssh_proxy_port` in `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` are correct and match the Host config.
3.  **Check Network Path to Host Proxy:** From your client, can you reach the Host's IP and `host_ssh_proxy_port`? `telnet <host_ip> <proxy_port>`. Firewalls are a common cause.
4.  **Check Host SSH Proxy Logs:** On the Host, check logs (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service` if proxy is part of Host service). Look for messages related to your client IP connecting, receiving the `REQUEST_TUNNEL <task_id>`, validating the task, attempting to connect to the Runner/VPS port, and any errors during forwarding.
5.  **Check Network Path from Host Proxy to Runner/VPS:** The Host proxy needs to connect to the Runner's IP and the VPS container's mapped port.
    *   Check if the Runner node is online (`hakuriver.client nodes`).
    *   Is a firewall on the Runner blocking the dynamically assigned SSH port?
    *   Can the Host machine itself connect to the Runner's IP and the specific SSH port? `telnet <runner_ip> <ssh_port>` (where `<runner_ip>` is from `hakuriver.client nodes` URL, and `<ssh_port>` is from `hakuriver.vps status`).
6.  **Check SSH Authentication:** If you reach a point where your `ssh` client tries to authenticate (e.g., prompted for passphrase, or gets "Permission denied (publickey)"), the connection path is likely fine, but authentication failed.
    *   Verify the public key you used during `vps submit` matches the private key used by your `ssh` client.
    *   Ensure the private key is available (`ssh-add -l`).
    *   Check SSH daemon logs *inside* the container (`docker logs hakuriver-vps-<task_id>`) for authentication errors. Look for messages like "Authentication failed for user root by publickey", "AuthorizedKeysFile /root/.ssh/authorized_keys invalid".
    *   Verify permissions of `/root/.ssh` (700) and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (600) inside the container.
    *   Ensure `PermitRootLogin yes` is set in `sshd_config` if connecting as root.
7.  **Host Key Verification Failed:**
    *   **Cause:** This usually happens on the *first connection* to a new VPS if the container generates fresh SSH host keys each time it starts, and your SSH client sees a different key than before.
    *   **Solution:** This is expected behavior for ephemeral containers. If you trust the connection, you can remove the old host key entry from your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. For persistent VPS tasks, generating host keys *in the image* during preparation can make them stable.
