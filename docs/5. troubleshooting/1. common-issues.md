# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions for common problems encountered when setting up or using HakuRiver. For issues not covered here, check the system logs on the Host and Runner nodes (`journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service`, `journalctl -u hakuriver-runner.service`) and provide detailed information when seeking help.

## Host Not Starting

**Symptom:** Running `hakuriver.host` or `sudo systemctl start hakuriver-host.service` fails.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **Configuration File Not Found or Invalid:**
    *   **Check:** Verify `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` exists and is valid TOML. Use a TOML linter if necessary.
    *   **Check:** If using `--config /path/to/custom.toml`, ensure the path is correct and readable by the user running the Host.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look in the console output or `journalctl -u hakuriver-host.service` for errors like `FileNotFoundError`, `toml.TomlDecodeError`, or "Error loading configuration".
    *   **Solution:** Correct the config path or fix TOML syntax errors.
2.  **Database Directory/File Permissions:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure the directory specified by `[database] db_file` exists and is writable by the user running the Host service. E.g., `ls -la /opt/hakuriver/` and check user permissions.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `peewee.OperationalError` mentioning inability to open the database file.
    *   **Solution:** Create the directory (`sudo mkdir -p /path/to/db`), set ownership (`sudo chown user:group /path/to/db`), and permissions (`sudo chmod 755 /path/to/db`).
3.  **Port Already In Use:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure `[network] host_port` and `[network] host_ssh_proxy_port` are not being used by another process on the Host. Use `sudo netstat -tulnp | grep <port>` or `sudo ss -tulnp | grep <port>`.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` or similar.
    *   **Solution:** Change the port numbers in `config.toml` and restart.
4.  **Python Environment/Dependencies:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure HakuRiver is installed correctly in the Python environment being used by the Host process (especially if using a virtual environment). If running via systemd, verify the `ExecStart` path points to the correct Python executable and `Environment="PATH=..."` is set correctly to include the virtual environment's `bin` directory.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `ImportError` for HakuRiver modules or required libraries (like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `peewee`, `httpx`, `docker`, `websockets`).
    *   **Solution:** Activate the correct venv and run `pip list` to check installed packages. Adjust systemd service file paths/environment.
5.  **Shared Directory Permissions/Existence:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure the directory specified by `[paths] shared_dir` exists and is writable by the user running the Host service. E.g., `ls -la /mnt/shared/hakuriver/` and check user permissions. This is crucial for creating the default container tarball on first run.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError` related to accessing the shared directory during startup or default container creation.
    *   **Solution:** Create the directory (`sudo mkdir -p <shared_dir>`), set ownership/permissions. Verify the shared filesystem is mounted if applicable.

## Runner Not Starting or Going Offline

**Symptom:** Running `hakuriver.runner` or `sudo systemctl start hakuriver-runner.service` fails, or a node appears as "offline" in `hakuriver.client nodes`.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **Configuration Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Verify `~/.hakuriver/config.toml` on the Runner is valid.
    *   **Check:** Ensure `[network] host_reachable_address` and `[network] host_port` correctly point to the *Host*.
    *   **Check:** Ensure `[network] runner_address` and `[network] runner_port` are correctly set for *this* Runner. `runner_address` must be reachable by the Host and unique among Runners.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for config loading errors or network connection errors.
    *   **Solution:** Correct the config file.
2.  **Cannot Reach Host:**
    *   **Check:** From the Runner, can you ping the Host's `host_reachable_address`? `ping <host_reachable_address>`.
    *   **Check:** Can you connect to the Host's API port? `telnet <host_reachable_address> <host_port>` (or use `nc -zv` or `nmap`).
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `httpx.RequestError` mentioning connection failures to the Host URL during registration or heartbeats.
    *   **Solution:** Verify network connectivity, Host service status, and firewalls on the Host.
3.  **Host Cannot Reach Runner (for commands):**
    *   **Check:** From the Host, can you ping the Runner's `runner_address`? `ping <runner_address>`.
    *   **Check:** Can you connect to the Runner's API port? `telnet <runner_address> <runner_port>`.
    *   **Check Logs (on Host):** Look for errors when Host tries to send a task (`POST /run`), kill, or command.
    *   **Check Logs (on Runner):** Look for errors binding to `runner_port`.
    *   **Solution:** Verify network connectivity, Runner service status, and firewalls on the Runner. Ensure `runner_address` is correctly set to an address reachable by the Host.
4.  **Docker Daemon Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Is Docker running on the Runner? `sudo systemctl status docker`.
    *   **Check:** Can the user running the Runner service access Docker? `docker ps` (run as that user, or check `sudo -u runner_username docker ps`). Is the user in the `docker` group?
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for errors related to Docker access or commands.
    *   **Solution:** Start Docker, add user to `docker` group (`sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`, then re-log or restart service), fix Docker installation if needed.
5.  **Shared Directory Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Is `[paths] shared_dir` correctly mounted and writable by the Runner user? `df -h <shared_dir>`, `ls -la <shared_dir>`.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError` when Runner tries to access the shared directory (e.g., during image sync or log writing).
    *   **Solution:** Correct mount configuration, permissions, or ensure the filesystem is mounted.
6.  **Systemd Service Path/Environment:**
    *   **Check:** If running via systemd, verify `ExecStart` and `Environment="PATH=..."` in the service file are correct for the Runner's environment.
    *   **Check Logs:** Look for `ImportError` or command not found errors (`hakuriver.cli.runner` or internal runner commands).
    *   **Solution:** Adjust service file paths/environment.
7.  **Timeout (Node Goes Offline After Starting):**
    *   **Check:** The Runner started and registered, but stopped sending heartbeats. Check Runner systemd logs for crashes or recurring errors that prevent the heartbeat task from running.
    *   **Check Logs (on Host):** Host will log when it marks a node offline due to heartbeat timeout.
    *   **Solution:** Identify the root cause of the Runner process instability from its logs.

## Task Submission Failures

**Symptom:** `hakuriver.task submit` or `hakuriver.vps submit` returns an error from the Host, or tasks get stuck in 'pending' or immediately go to 'failed' or 'assigning' with suspicion.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **Client Configuration Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure `[network] host_reachable_address` and `[network] host_port` in the client's config point to the Host.
    *   **Check Logs (Client):** CLI output will show `httpx.RequestError` or `HTTPStatusError` if it fails to connect or Host rejects the request.
    *   **Solution:** Correct client config, verify network to Host, check Host status and firewall.
2.  **Invalid Target Specified:**
    *   **Check:** Is the hostname in `--target` correct and registered? (Check `hakuriver.client nodes`).
    *   **Check:** If using `:NUMA_ID`, is the ID an integer? Is it valid for the target node's detected topology? (Check `hakuriver.client health <node>`).
    *   **Check:** If using `::GPU_IDs`, are the IDs integers? Are they valid for the target node's detected GPUs? (Check `hakuriver.client health <node>`).
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs invalid target warnings or errors during submission processing.
    *   **Solution:** Correct the `--target` string format and values.
3.  **Target Node Offline or Unavailable:**
    *   **Check:** Is the `--target` node 'online' in `hakuriver.client nodes`?
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs warnings/errors if it skips an offline target.
    *   **Solution:** Wait for the Runner to come online, or target a different node.
4.  **Insufficient Resources on Target Node:**
    *   **Check:** Does the target node have enough `available_cores` in `hakuriver.client nodes` for the `required_cores`?
    *   **Check:** Is the node reporting sufficient free memory in `hakuriver.client health <node>` for the `required_memory_bytes`?
    *   **Check:** If requesting GPUs, are the specific `::GPU_IDs` available (not in use by other running tasks)? Use `hakuriver.client health <node>` and check task status list.
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs warnings/errors if it skips a target due to insufficient resources.
    *   **Solution:** Request fewer resources, free up resources on the target node, or target a different node with sufficient resources.
5.  **Host Failed to Dispatch to Runner:**
    *   **Symptom:** Task status goes from 'pending' directly to 'failed' with a "Failed to contact runner" error, or stays in 'assigning' with high suspicion count.
    *   **Check:** Can the Host reach the Runner's `runner_address` and `runner_port`? (See Runner Not Starting).
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs errors when attempting to send `POST /run` to the Runner.
    *   **Solution:** Fix network connectivity or Runner process/config issues.
6.  **Invalid Public Key Format (VPS Tasks):**
    *   **Check:** Ensure the public key string provided via `--public-key-string` or read from `--public-key-file` is in the correct `ssh-rsa AAAA...` or similar valid format.
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host validates the key format during submission and will log errors.
    *   **Solution:** Provide a correctly formatted public key.
7.  **Container Not Found or Sync Failed:**
    *   **Symptom:** Task goes to 'failed' shortly after 'assigning' with a message about Docker image load failure.
    *   **Check:** Does the tarball for the `--container` name exist in `shared_dir/container_dir` on the Runner? (Check `ls <shared_dir>/hakuriver-containers/` on the Runner).
    *   **Check:** Are permissions correct on the shared directory for the Runner to read the tarball?
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs Docker load errors (`docker load -i <tarball>`).
    *   **Solution:** Create the container tarball on the Host (`hakuriver.docker create-tar <name>`), verify shared storage access on the Runner.
8.  **Invalid Task/Container Combination:**
    *   **Check:** Are you requesting `::GPU_IDs` with `--container NULL`? (Not allowed).
    *   **Check:** Are you submitting a VPS task with `--container NULL`? (Not allowed).
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host will reject these invalid combinations during submission.
    *   **Solution:** Use a Docker container for GPU or VPS tasks.

## Task Runtime Failures

**Symptom:** Task status changes to 'failed', 'killed_oom', 'lost', or 'killed'.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **Script/Command Error:**
    *   **Symptom:** Status 'failed', exit code is non-zero, error message might be generic.
    *   **Check:** View `hakuriver.task stdout <task_id>` and `hakuriver.task stderr <task_id>` (for Command tasks) or check relevant logs for VPS tasks.
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs errors encountered *while trying to run* the task command itself.
    *   **Solution:** Debug your script or command using the output logs. Run it manually on the Runner node inside a similar Docker environment or systemd scope if possible to reproduce.
2.  **Out Of Memory (OOM):**
    *   **Symptom:** Status 'killed_oom', exit code may be specific (-9 or 137 for Docker). Error message often mentions OOM kill.
    *   **Check:** Review the task's memory limit (`required_memory_bytes`) and the Runner's available memory (`hakuriver.client health <node>`).
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Docker logs or kernel logs might indicate OOM kill events.
    *   **Solution:** Increase the memory limit (`--memory SIZE`) for the task, run on a node with more available memory, or optimize the task's memory usage.
3.  **Task Manually Killed:**
    *   **Symptom:** Status 'killed', error message "Kill requested by user."
    *   **Solution:** This is expected if you or another user explicitly killed the task (`hakuriver.client kill`).
4.  **Node Went Offline:**
    *   **Symptom:** Status 'lost', error message mentions node going offline.
    *   **Check:** Is the assigned node 'offline' in `hakuriver.client nodes`?
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs when it marks a node as 'lost'.
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Check the Runner's logs on that node for why it stopped or lost network connectivity.
    *   **Solution:** Troubleshoot the Runner node (`Runner Not Starting/Going Offline`). Re-submit the task once the node is back online.
5.  **Systemd Permission Issues (Systemd fallback):**
    *   **Symptom:** Task 'failed' shortly after 'assigning', error message related to `systemd-run` or `numactl` permissions.
    *   **Check:** Verify the runner user has passwordless `sudo` access configured correctly for `systemd-run`, `systemctl`, and `numactl` (if used). Check Runner logs for `sudo` errors.
    *   **Solution:** Edit `/etc/sudoers` using `visudo` to add the necessary `NOPASSWD` entries for the runner user.
6.  **Docker Runtime Issues:**
    *   **Symptom:** Task 'failed', error message mentions Docker daemon or container runtime errors.
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs Docker command execution failures. Check Docker logs (`sudo journalctl -u docker.service`).
    *   **Solution:** Debug the Docker environment or runtime on the Runner node.
7.  **GPU Allocation Issues (Docker tasks):**
    *   **Symptom:** Task 'failed' on startup, error message relates to GPUs or devices. Status might be 'failed' or container exits immediately.
    *   **Check:** Did you request valid GPU IDs? (Check `hakuriver.client health <node>`).
    *   **Check:** Is NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured for Docker on the Runner? (`docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:base nvidia-smi`).
    *   **Check:** Does the container image contain necessary CUDA/GPU libraries compatible with the driver?
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs Docker command (`docker run --gpus...`) errors.
    *   **Solution:** Correct GPU IDs, install/configure NVIDIA Container Toolkit, rebuild container with correct libraries.

## VPS SSH Connection Issues (`hakuriver.ssh`)

**Symptom:** `hakuriver.ssh <task_id>` fails to connect, shows connection refused, timeout, or permission denied errors.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **VPS Task Not Running or Not Found:**
    *   **Check:** Verify the task ID is correct and the VPS status is 'running' or 'paused' in `hakuriver.vps status`.
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host SSH proxy logs validation failures if task ID is wrong or status is not active.
    *   **Solution:** Use correct task ID, wait for VPS to start, or re-submit if it failed.
2.  **Network Path from Client to Host Proxy:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure your client machine can reach the Host's IP and `host_ssh_proxy_port` (e.g., check firewalls).
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host SSH proxy logs will show connection attempts or failures.
    *   **Solution:** Verify network connectivity and firewall on the Host.
3.  **Host Proxy Cannot Connect to Runner/VPS:**
    *   **Check:** Is the Runner node assigned to the VPS online? (`hakuriver.client nodes`).
    *   **Check:** Did the VPS container start successfully and report its SSH port? (Check `hakuriver.vps status` and `hakuriver.client status <task_id>`). Is the SSH port > 0?
    *   **Check:** Is a firewall on the Runner blocking connection *from* the Host *to* the dynamically assigned SSH port? Docker often manages these ports, but local firewalls might interfere.
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host SSH proxy logs connection attempts and failures to the Runner/VPS port.
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs Docker container startup errors, including SSH daemon issues.
    *   **Solution:** Troubleshoot Runner/VPS startup, check Runner firewalls (less common), ensure VPS container's SSH daemon is running and listening.
4.  **SSH Authentication Failure:**
    *   **Symptom:** Connection reaches the container, but `ssh` client reports permission denied, public key issues, etc.
    *   **Check:** Does the public key you submitted match your local private key (`ssh-add -l`)?
    *   **Check:** Is the container environment set up for SSH (sshd installed, running)? Is public key auth enabled? Is root login permitted (if connecting as root)? Is the key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (or equivalent for `runner_user`) with correct permissions (700 for `.ssh`, 600 for `authorized_keys`)?
    *   **Check Logs (Runner):** Runner logs from `run_task_background` (for VPS startup) or systemd logs for the container itself (`docker logs <container_name>`) might show SSH daemon errors.
    *   **Solution:** Debug the SSH setup inside your container environment.

## Docker Management Issues (`hakuriver.docker`)

**Symptom:** `hakuriver.docker` commands fail, e.g., cannot list containers, create/delete containers, or create tarballs.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1.  **Docker Daemon on Host Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Is Docker running on the Host? `sudo systemctl status docker`.
    *   **Check:** Can the user running the `hakuriver.docker` command (or the Host service user if called via API) access Docker? Is the user in the `docker` group?
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host service logs will show Docker command execution errors.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure Docker is running and the user has access.
2.  **Shared Directory Issues (for tar commands):**
    *   **Check:** Is `[paths] shared_dir` correctly mounted and writable by the Host user?
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs errors during `docker save` (create tar) or directory scanning.
    *   **Solution:** Verify shared storage setup on the Host.
3.  **Container Not Found:**
    *   **Check:** Ensure the container name used in commands like `start-container`, `stop-container`, `delete-container`, `create-tar` actually exists on the Host's Docker daemon. `docker ps -a`.
    *   **Check Logs (Host):** Host logs Docker errors if container is not found.
    *   **Solution:** Use the correct container name.
